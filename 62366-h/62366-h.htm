<h2>Translator&rsquo;s Preface</h2>
<p>There are five representatives of the Columbus
family more or less famous in the history
of exploration, <i>viz.</i>, Christopher, the discoverer
of America; Bartolomeo, brother of Christopher,
governor of Isabella and founder of San
Domingo; Diego, brother of Christopher, who accompanied
him on his second voyage and subsequently
entered the priesthood; Diego, son of
Christopher, and his successor as governor of Hispaniola;
Ferdinand, illegitimate son of Christopher,
who accompanied his father on his fourth voyage
and became his biographer; and Colon, grandson
of Christopher, who was made Duke of Veraqua,
Marquis of Jamaica, and Captain-general of Hispaniola;
but all of them shine in the reflected light
of Christopher, except his brother Bartolomeo, who,
while not as skilful a navigator and explorer as his
brother, was a great soldier, an experienced administrator,
and the principal support of Christopher in
his many difficulties and hardships.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_vi">vi</div>
<p>The story of Columbus, apart from his discovery
of America and his many thrilling adventures in the
West Indies, should be one of absorbing interest to
youth. It is the story of a man who in his youthful
days conceived a vast project, for his time, adhered
to it with inflexible resolution though confronted
with obstacles which would have discouraged any
ordinary man, suffered privations and hardships of
the most trying kind, meeting threats against his
life, shipwreck, physical ailments, poverty, malicious
attacks of bitter enemies, shameful calumnies, the
disgrace of being sent to Spain in fetters by Bobadilla,
his jealous and cruel rival, and the ingratitude
and dishonesty of the King of Spain, and yet accomplished
a purpose even greater than that which
first inspired him, for he died not knowing that he
had discovered a new continent. He supposed to
the last that the region he had found was the East
Indies. The great navigator, seaman, and explorer
passed his last days in poverty and neglect, and
the rewards which the King had promised were
enjoyed not by him but by his son Diego. But
his fame is immortal.</p>

<h2 id="c1"><span class="h2line1">Chapter I</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Portuguese Voyages of Discovery&mdash;The Youth of Columbus&mdash;His Arrival at Lisbon</span></h2>
<p>The ancient Greeks were not the only nation
which imagined there was a region in the
Atlantic Ocean, an island beyond the Pillars
of Hercules, the sea highway, now called the Straits
of Gibraltar. The traditions of other people tell of
a land where only happy mortals dwell. Greek
poetry assigned this region to the ocean, which was
supposed to surround the world as it was known at
that time. The Romans also believed in this distant
western land, and in the Christian Middle
Ages these same traditions were carefully preserved.
It was told that many an adventurer sought these
Islands of the Blest but never returned home.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>The seafarers of the Middle Ages must have been
timid navigators for they never reached the open
sea but contented themselves with cruising along
its shore. At last the Genoese and Venetians,
whose cities were very prosperous in the fourteenth
century, because of their expanding commerce,
ventured out of the Straits of Gibraltar. Their
course, however, was not southward but north of the
straits which connect the Mediterranean Sea with
the ocean, for it is well known that the Venetians
in 1318 reached Antwerp by vessel.</p>
<p>Simultaneously with these efforts of the Italians
to reach the north, the Portuguese were striving to
discover a passage to the rich Indies in vessels
manned almost entirely by Italian sailors. The
Genoese also undertook independent voyages of
discovery. Two ships which passed through the
Straits of Gibraltar at the close of the thirteenth
century never came back. A Genoese expedition
at the beginning of the fourteenth century discovered
the Canary Islands, but the explorers declared they
were not the Islands of the Blest. Before the year
1335 a Portuguese vessel returned to Lisbon from
the Canaries with products of the soil and kidnapped
natives. In July, 1341, two large and
well armed vessels, under command of a Genoese
and a Florentine, reached the Canaries in five days
from Lisbon. They held possession of the islands
until November. It is also known that Europeans
stopped for some time at Teneriffe,<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a> where they found
almost naked but fierce natives who lived in stone
houses, tilled the soil, and worshipped idols. About
the close of the fourteenth century thirteen friars
attempted the conversion of the natives of the
larger Canaries but were massacred by the savages.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>About this time the islands of Madeira and the
Azores were discovered but they were uninhabited.
The Canaries alone had inhabitants, called Guanches.<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a>
These Guanches lived upon seven islands, but,
as there were no means of communication between
them, they knew little of each other. Their dialects
indeed were so different that they could not
understand one another. Wheat and barley were
cultivated. The natives on the islands of Gomera
and Palma went naked, lived in caves, and subsisted
upon roots and goats&rsquo; milk, and were dangerous
enemies with their stone weapons and horn-tipped
spears. The natives on the larger Canaries were
the most civilized and had two large cities and
thirty-three communities. Their two kings were at
constant variance. The warlike Guanches were only
subjugated after fierce encounters, for they climbed
with the ease of goats and were such fleet runners
that they could overtake the hare. When asked
about their origin, they replied: &ldquo;After the submission
of our ancestors the gods placed us in these
islands, left us here, and forgot us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>Remarkable success crowned the explorations of
the Portuguese owing to the enterprise and zeal of
the Infante, Henry,<a class="fn" id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a> third son of King John the First,
who was surnamed by posterity &ldquo;The Navigator.&rdquo;
His lean, angular person hardly bespoke his real
greatness. His perseverance and indomitable resolution
were apparent alone in his clear, open look.
He was a man of great abstemiousness. Wine
never passed his lips. He spent his revenues
upon exploration and conquests on the west coast
of Africa. The voyages of the Portuguese discoverers
began in the Autumn of 1415 but the first
navigators returned after reaching Cape Bajador,
for they dared not venture out into the open sea
because of the breakers and dangerous ledges.
Four years later two explorers, driven out to sea
by a storm, reached the island of Porto Santo,
previously discovered by the Italians, and from there
went to Madeira, or the &ldquo;Forest Island,&rdquo; as it was
called. It was not until 1434 that Cape Bajador
was circumnavigated by a daring man who had
offended the Infante and by this exploit regained his
favor. He brought back flowers in earthen vessels
to prove that floral beauty was not lacking on the
other side of the dreaded cape.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>Further attempts were made in succeeding years.
The Portuguese continually advanced and once
brought home fish nets which they had taken from
the natives to prove that the lands beyond the Cape
were inhabited. Soon they penetrated to regions
where they found gold-dust and other valuable
products, which were taken in honor of the Infante.
In consideration of the tremendous expense and the
incalculable exertion involved in these voyages the
matter of profit was alone taken into account.
Naturally no heed was paid to their scientific importance.
Explorations beyond the Cape at last
proved very profitable and many vessels returned
with large cargoes of slaves, for Europeans at that
time were not ashamed of man-stealing. They
hunted their human victims openly and even used
dogs to run down their prey. Slavery was not
abhorrent to them. They thought it natural that
God should reward their man-stealing with success.
A chronicle of the year 1444 says: &ldquo;At last it
pleased God to compensate them for their great suffering
in His service with a glorious day&rsquo;s efforts,
for altogether, in men, women, and children, they
captured one hundred and sixty-five head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An important discovery in the year 1445 removed
many erroneous conceptions. Dinas Diaz in that
year sailed farther south than any navigator had
gone before. He passed Cape Blanco, reached the
southern line of the Great Desert, and found a region
green with palms, and people with black skins.
The spot he discovered was called the &ldquo;Green Cape.&rdquo;
He proved that the theory that the tropics were
uninhabitable was false. Aristotle had maintained
that the tropical regions must be unpeopled because
the overpowering heat of the sun&rsquo;s rays would destroy
all vegetation. Other scholars, among them Ptolemy,
were of the same opinion. The theory indeed
was so universally accepted at the beginning of the
fifteenth century that many a bold adventurer
was deterred from making explorations in that
direction.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>In the same year, however, the Senegal, which
Diaz had passed unobserved, was discovered on a
second voyage. The river was declared to be a
branch of the Egyptian Nile. In the following year
the Portuguese met with a serious disaster on the
African coast. Two vessels, owing to the misplaced
confidence of their commanders in the negroes,
ventured too near and were greeted by a shower of
poisoned arrows. The wounded explorers died after
reaching Lisbon, two months later, without having
seen anything but sky and water. This disaster,
however, did not deter other brave navigators from
undertaking further explorations beyond the Green
Cape, though they dreaded the poisoned arrows of
the natives more than any hardships or perils of
the sea.</p>
<p>About this time the Azores were colonized by the
Portuguese, for these islands had been so little
disturbed by man that even the birds could easily
be taken by the hand. Henry, the Infante, bestowed
the islands upon the explorers as an hereditary
tenure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>In the second half of the fifteenth century, during
the reign of Alfonso the Fifth, we have very inadequate
reports of the progress of Portuguese exploration.
We know, however, that the explorers advanced
along the rivers of West Africa, especially the Gambia,
which stream they ascended to transact business
with caravans from the Soudan. It was at that time
the European world began traffic in the great and
rich resources of Central Africa. On the thirteenth
of November, 1460, the Infante died, and the
prosperity which had attended Portuguese explorations
languished. History has honored him with
the surname &ldquo;Navigator,&rdquo; though he took no personal
part in exploration. Under his encouragement,
the Portuguese, who before his time had
timidly returned home from Cape Bajador, became
bold seafarers. Discoveries rapidly advanced in his
lifetime but Alfonso the Fifth wasted his inheritance.
He gave no thought to new explorations for those
already made were yielding him rich returns. The
sugar plantations in Madeira brought him large
profits, slaves were exchanged for horses, and the
coast supplied great store of gold-dust, musk, ivory,
and ginger. Notwithstanding their discouragement,
the explorers pushed farther south. Before the
close of the fifteenth century they found the Zaira,
the Congo of our maps. King John the Second, like
&ldquo;Navigator&rdquo; Henry, was greatly interested in sea
voyages and the sciences. Under his patronage
Bartholomew Dias, in 1486, left Lisbon with two
small vessels and a supply boat, sailed south, and
passed the mouth of the Congo. As the wind was
contrary he put out to sea but was so driven about
by storms that at last he found the coast of Africa
on his left. He had rounded the southern extremity
of the Dark Continent and, finding land, he kept on
in a northerly direction.<a class="fn" id="fr_4" href="#fn_4">[4]</a> His sailors, however,
refused to go farther and insisted he should return.
As he could not conciliate them, he began the home
voyage reluctantly, passing again the mysterious
cape, which he named Tormentoso, the name being
subsequently changed by John the Second to Good
Hope, and reached Lisbon in December, 1487, after
an absence of sixteen months and seventeen days.
Dias was poorly rewarded for his great discovery.
He was not given command of a fleet a second time,
but served as a simple captain under Cabral,<a class="fn" id="fr_5" href="#fn_5">[5]</a> the
discoverer of Brazil, and, in rounding the Cape of
Good Hope during a fearful storm, May 23, 1500,
was drowned.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>Even before Dias had found the Cape of Good
Hope an Italian explorer, named Cristoforo Colombo,
appeared at the court of John the Second. When
subsequently he made Spain his home, he was called
Colon.<a class="fn" id="fr_6" href="#fn_6">[6]</a> He is best known by his Latin name,
Columbus. This extraordinary man was born at
Genoa in the year 1456.<a class="fn" id="fr_7" href="#fn_7">[7]</a> Genoese contemporaries
assure us his father, Domenico, was a wool-comber.
Domenico had four children: three sons, Cristoforo,
Bartolomeo, and Giacomo (Diego),<a class="fn" id="fr_8" href="#fn_8">[8]</a> and one daughter,
of whom it is only known that she married an
Italian innkeeper. From his earliest youth Christopher
loved the sea. As a lad he showed promise
of being a skilful sailor and brave man. He was
active and courageous, had no delight in indolence
or effeminate luxuries, and despised all delicacies
which tickle the palate and weaken the health.
His highest ambition was to secure all the knowledge
he could so as to be of some service to his fellow men.
In a short time he learned the Latin language, in
which all the scientific books of the time were
written, and, although a boy in those days could
learn but very little of the sciences, compared with
what can be done to-day, yet he acquired sufficient
knowledge of them to become an authority. His
father, who was comfortably well off, sent him to the
University of Pavia where he studied geography,
geometry, astronomy, and drawing. At fourteen
he had made such advances that he was qualified
to become a ship captain and go to sea. He exerted
his utmost effort to investigate the ocean and its
routes. The saying, &ldquo;as the twig is bent, the tree&rsquo;s
inclined,&rdquo; well applies to him. He determined to
become a great seafarer and from his earliest youth
adhered to the determination until it was fully
realized.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>Our young hero had his first experience in the
Mediterranean Sea, for the voyages of his people
at that time did not extend farther. It was much
too confined a sphere, however, for a spirit which
burned with the desire to accomplish unprecedented
achievements. After a voyage to the northern ocean,
during which he reached Iceland and gathered valuable
experience, he entered the service of a kinsman,
a sea-captain, who had fitted out a few vessels
at his own expense, with which he cruised at one
time against the Venetians, at another against
the Turks, seeking to capture their galleys. Upon
one of their cruises, the young Columbus would
have lost his life had not Providence preserved it
for high purposes. In a stubborn fight with the
Venetians, in which our young hero performed
prodigies of valor, his ship as well as those with
which it was engaged took fire. Columbus found
himself in a desperate situation but even with death
staring him in the face he had no fear. He boldly
plunged into the sea, clutched a floating oar, and
with its help swam safely to the shore, two miles
distant. He landed upon the Portuguese coast
and, as soon as he had rested, made his way to
Lisbon.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>This event had a marked influence upon his
future career, for in the Portuguese capital his
knowledge and ability were of great service in
securing friends among seafarers, with whom plans
were discussed for the discovery of a passage to the
East Indies. An event soon happened which greatly
promoted the ambitious purpose of his life. He married
Felipa Perestrelli, daughter of a sea-captain,
one of the early colonists and first governor of Porto
Santo. This gave him possession of the diaries and
charts of his experienced father-in-law, and as he
studied them day and night his desire to visit these
newly discovered islands grew stronger. He once
more went on shipboard, made a voyage to Madeira,
and for some time carried on a lucrative business,
visiting the Canaries, the African coast, and the
Azores in the meantime.</p>

<br /><span class="h2line2">Columbus&rsquo; Scheme Rejected in Lisbon&mdash;He Goes to Madrid and Has an Interview with Ferdinand and Isabella, after which he Endures Bitter Disappointments</span></h2>
<p>During the short voyages which Columbus
made from the Canary Islands he was still
busy with the great scheme upon which he
was engaged in Lisbon. He often said to himself:
&ldquo;There must be a nearer route by sea to the Indies
than that attempted by the Portuguese. If one
sails from here across the ocean in a westerly direction
he must at last reach a country which is either India
or some region adjacent to it. Is not the earth
round? And if round, must not God have created
countries upon the other side of it, upon which
men and other creatures live? Is it at all likely that
the whole hemisphere is covered by the ocean? No!
No! India certainly is a vaster region than people
believe. It must stretch far from the east toward
Europe. Then if one sails straight to the west he
must eventually reach it.&rdquo; This was not his only
reasoning. Several other considerations strengthened
his belief and this one among them: A
Portuguese navigator once, sailing far to the west,
found curiously wrought sticks floating in the sea,
which came from the westward. This fact convinced
him there must be an inhabited country in that
direction. Columbus&rsquo; father-in-law, on one of his
voyages, found similar sticks which had been driven
by the west winds. Felled trees of a kind unknown
there had been found on the west shores of the
Azores, evidently blown there by west winds. The
bodies of two men had been washed ashore on these
same coasts, with strange, broad faces, evidently
not Europeans, and unlike the people of Asia and
Africa.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>Columbus carefully gathered all these facts,
pondered over them day and night, and, after comparing
with them such information as he found
in old as well as contemporary authors, became
thoroughly convinced that his theories were correct.
He remembered, however, that &ldquo;to err is human&rdquo;
and that four eyes are better than two. Thinking
it unwise to rely upon his own opinions alone, he
consulted a man whose learning and wisdom made
his advice of the highest value. This was Toscanelli,
a Florentine physician, born in 1397. He was
very old at this time, but he had already declared
his belief to Alfonso the Fifth that a voyage across
the Atlantic Ocean to the East Indies was perfectly
practical, and had sent a chart to Lisbon upon which
the distance and choice of routes was traced. Toscanelli
approved the scheme of Columbus and not
only gave him much valuable advice but urged him
to put his plans in operation as soon as possible.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>Columbus was now fully determined to set about
his work but he needed assistance in his preparations.
Some government must help him and to which one
should he give the preference? He promptly decided
that his own dear fatherland should participate in
the honor of his discoveries. He submitted his
scheme to the Genoese Council and asked for the necessary
assistance. The Council, however, attached
no importance to it, regarded him as an inexperienced
man, and rejected his proposals. He was discouraged
by its decision but, feeling that he had at least performed
his duty to his fatherland, he went to Lisbon
to submit his plans to the Court, which at this time
was more friendly to expeditions than any other.
He waited upon King John the Second and asked
permission of him and his Council to carry out the
scheme upon which he had been engaged so many
years. His proposition was favorably considered
but subsequently his plan was stolen little by little
and he found himself the victim of most despicable
treachery. The Portuguese hastily fitted up a
vessel and placed it in command of another leader,
who sailed away on Columbus&rsquo; course; but he had
neither the latter&rsquo;s skill nor courage and, after a
short western voyage, abandoned the undertaking as
hopeless and returned to Lisbon. Indignant at such
treachery, Columbus forsook a Court which had
treated him so meanly and went with his son, Diego,
to Madrid. As his wife had died some time before
this he never returned to Lisbon. Fearing possibly
that his scheme might not be accepted at the Spanish
Court, he sent his brother Bartolomeo, who was
familiar with all the details of his plan, to England,
to ascertain whether he could expect help in that
quarter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>Ferdinand of Arragon was the ruler of Spain at
this time (1484). His cautious and suspicious
nature led him to regard with disfavor any scheme
which was in the least doubtful. His consort, Isabella
of Castile, was much bolder, but she depended
entirely upon her husband and would not engage
in anything that met with his disapproval. Unfortunately
also at this time the King was at war
with the Moors, who were in power at Grenada.
Under such circumstances what could Columbus
expect from the King? Eventually he was hospitably
received by Ferdinand and Isabella and was
listened to attentively. Before making a decision
one way or the other, however, the King decided
to submit the scheme to other advisers who unfortunately
had not sufficient knowledge to examine it
intelligently. They interposed silly objections. One
maintained that the ocean between Europe and the
Indies was so immeasurably vast that even the most
favorable voyage from Europe to the nearest land
would take at least three years. Another, in view
of the roundness of the earth, insisted that one
sailing west would be going down hill and that when
he wished to return he would have to come up hill,
which would be impossible, however propitious the
wind might be. Others were insolent enough to ask
him whether he imagined he was the only wise man
among the millions of the world, and, if there really
was land on the other side, how it happened that
it had remained unknown for centuries.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>Columbus needed all his resolution and patience
to endure the ignorance and insolence of his critics,
but he retained his composure and answered each
foolish objection seriously. But of what avail was
it? After striving in vain for five years to convince
these and other ignoramuses that his scheme was
feasible, he had the added mortification of learning
that the King sided with them. He received from
the Court the unfavorable reply that so long as the
war with the Moors continued the King could not consider
any other undertaking. Columbus, of course,
was disappointed and had lost much valuable time,
but he steadfastly adhered to his purpose. Far from
abandoning it, he applied to two Spanish dukes<a class="fn" id="fr_9" href="#fn_9">[9]</a>
who were wealthy enough to fit up a small exploring
squadron. They were lacking, however, in faith and
courage and did not care to engage in a scheme
which was too expensive for the King. Columbus
was again disappointed but concealed his vexation
and, without wasting any more time on useless
applications, made preparations to bid farewell to
Spain (1491) and go to the King of France from whom
he had received an encouraging letter while at the
Spanish Court. He started for that country with
his son Diego. Arrived at the flourishing seaport of
Palos<a class="fn" id="fr_10" href="#fn_10">[10]</a> he knocked at the door of a Franciscan
monastery<a class="fn" id="fr_11" href="#fn_11">[11]</a> and asked the doorkeeper for bread and
water for his exhausted son. The learned Brother,
Juan Perez de Marchena, guardian of the monastery,
who was father confessor to the Queen, observed the
wanderers. He entered into conversation with
Columbus, who acquainted him in a most interesting
manner with his plans and his misfortunes. The
Brother listened to his statements with eager attention,
believed his scheme reasonable, and urged him
to remain until he could write to the Queen and
receive her reply.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>Columbus assented. The Brother wrote the letter
and made such a convincing statement as to the
feasibility of the scheme that Isabella suddenly
changed her mind and wrote a reply, urging Columbus
to return to the Court. The sorely tried and
much disappointed man took heart again and obeyed
the Queen&rsquo;s summons. Isabella received him
graciously and expressed the hope that his scheme
would prove successful; but, alas, the timid, wavering
King marred all. He called the same ignoramuses
in council again and, as they made the same report,
he would hear nothing of western voyages and
notified Isabella to break off the intercourse with
Columbus.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>Columbus&rsquo; spirit, however, was stronger than that
of his enemies. He roused himself anew and was
making preparations to go to England and offer her
King the great reward which three governments
had contemptuously refused, when the news came
that the Moors had been vanquished and their
power in Spain ended. Ferdinand and Isabella
were delighted with the outcome of the struggle
which made them rulers of all Spain. Two friends
of Columbus took advantage of the situation to
urge his scheme upon the Queen&rsquo;s consideration and
convince her that the royal authority would be
greatly extended by it. Owing to the zeal and enthusiasm
with which they espoused his cause, the
King and Queen at last decided to make no further
opposition. A messenger was despatched to Columbus
and he was brought back in triumph to the Court,
where the Queen impatiently awaited him. Forgetting
all his sickening disappointments and blighted
hopes, Columbus submitted his terms and when they
were finally accepted he felt that at last his dearest
wishes were realized. He asked for himself and his
heirs elevation to the nobility, the rank of admiral,
the authority of vice-royalty over all he should
discover, and a tenth of all gains by conquest in
trade.</p>

<p>It is not strange the King was reluctant to give
up any part of such valuable revenues and to concede
such important privileges, especially as the new
country might be larger than the mother country,
and the representative of the King more powerful
than the King himself&mdash;but Isabella was fully
determined to recognize Columbus&rsquo; undertaking
and would not listen to any objections. She said:
&ldquo;I will pledge my crown of Castile for the success
of this scheme and my jewels also if sufficient money
is not raised to carry it out.&rdquo;</p>

<br /><span class="h2line2">Three Vessels Fitted Out for Columbus&mdash;The First Voyage of Discovery is made from Palos, August 3, 1492&mdash;Columbus on the Open Sea</span></h2>
<p>Columbus was overjoyed at the success
which at last crowned his efforts and at once
began actively fitting out the necessary vessels.
Those which the King placed at his disposal
were so small and poorly built that no man
but Columbus would have trusted himself in
them upon a vast, unknown sea whose dangerous
spots were uncharted. The vessel which he commanded
was named the <i>Santa Maria</i>; the second,
the <i>Pinta</i>; and the third, the <i>Nina</i>. The last two
were hardly larger than good-sized boats. The little
squadron was provided with subsistence for twelve
months and ninety men.<a class="fn" id="fr_12" href="#fn_12">[12]</a> The cost of the expedition
was not more than 5300 ducats, a sum which
at that time seemed so large to the impoverished
Court that the whole undertaking might have been
abandoned had it not been that the citizens of
Palos provided two of the vessels, the King sending
only one. At last all the preparations were
made and the vessels lay at their anchors ready
to sail.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>Before weighing anchor, however, Columbus considered
it a duty to invoke the favor of the Creator
of the ocean, the Creator and Ruler of all the earth,
for the expedition which he had so much at heart,
for it was also his purpose to spread the knowledge
of the only true God in the ignorant wilderness
whither Divine Providence was to conduct him.
Accompanied by all his companions, Columbus
went in solemn procession to a monastery in the
vicinity of Palos and there publicly implored divine
help, his seamen following his pious example. Then
they returned, full of confidence in the Most High.
The next morning, August 3, 1492, they set sail in
God&rsquo;s name amid the cheers of a great multitude
of spectators. Columbus commanded the larger
vessel, the <i>Santa Maria</i>, and the two brothers,
Martin and Vicente Pinzon, the two smaller vessels.</p>
<p>According to Columbus&rsquo; plans the fleet was to
sail first to the Canaries, but on the second day out
a slight accident happened which might have ruined
the expedition if Columbus had been as weak as
his superstitious comrades. The rudder of the <i>Pinta</i>
was broken, purposely, it is believed, by the helmsman,
who was afraid of the voyage and hoped in
this manner to force Columbus to go back. The
crew declared that the accident foretold disaster.
&ldquo;We shall be lost,&rdquo; they shouted, &ldquo;if we do not go
back at once.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>&ldquo;But why?&rdquo; asked Columbus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; they replied. &ldquo;Heaven has already shown
clearly enough by this broken rudder that it will
be disastrous if we do not abandon the undertaking
at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really do not know,&rdquo; answered Columbus,
&ldquo;how you have learned that this unexpected event
is a sign of coming disaster. So far as I know, a
broken rudder only means that we must mend
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Admiral is a freethinker,&rdquo; the seamen whispered
to each other; &ldquo;he does not believe in signs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Columbus, who knew their thoughts, realized the
necessity of overcoming as far as possible the superstition
of his ignorant companions, as a hundred
opportunities might occur for similar outbreaks.
He explained the matter to them in detail and
showed them how unreasonable it was to regard it
as a sign of future disaster, for God had never
promised He would make the future known by signs.
Wisely and mercifully Heaven had concealed the
future from us. Therefore it was useless and foolish
to expect disaster because of any sign. All that a
wise and pious man could do was to perform his
duties faithfully and industriously all his days,
trusting in divine oversight and having no fear of
the future. &ldquo;Let this be the rule to govern us
throughout our voyage,&rdquo; said he. By representations
of this kind Columbus, although he could not entirely
remove their superstitious fears, rendered them
less dangerous. Nothing further of particular consequence
happened and at last they came to anchor
at the Canary Islands. There the necessary repairs
were made and on the sixth of September they
weighed anchor and started upon their great western
voyage over the uncharted sea.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>Little progress was made the first day, as they
were becalmed, but on the second, some say the
third, the Canaries disappeared from view. They
were hardly out of sight of land when the seamen
began to lose courage. They wept, beat their
breasts, and cried aloud as if they were going to
instant destruction. Columbus stood steadfast as
a rock in the ocean, undisturbed by their deafening
wails, and showing such composure and confidence
that the cowards plucked up a little courage. He
made them ashamed of their weakness, and so clearly
explained to them the honor and profit which they
would receive at the end of the voyage that all
were inspired by his words and promised to follow
wherever he should lead.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>Columbus devoted most of his time on the deck
of his vessel to the plummet and instruments of
observation. The plummet, a heavy piece of lead,
attached to a long rope, was let down into the water
to ascertain its depth, and thus avoid the danger of
stranding. The exact location of the vessel at any
given time was ascertained in Columbus&rsquo; day by
the astrolabe,<a class="fn" id="fr_13" href="#fn_13">[13]</a> with the help of the location of the
stars and their distance from each other. To-day
mariners have much more perfect instruments for
observation. Columbus made all his measurements
and observations himself. He gave only a few hours
to sleep and rest, in the meantime exhibiting such
composure as to impress even the weakest of his
sailors with confidence in him and his undertaking.
Only to such a man was this great task possible.
In the hands of a man of less courage, foresight, and
ability it must have failed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="h2line1">Chapter IV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Ocean Phenomena, Unknown to Columbus and His Crew, Increase the Fear of the Latter</span></h2>
<p>On the second day after leaving the Canary
Islands they made but eighteen miles, owing
to light winds. As Columbus foresaw that
nothing would intimidate his ignorant crew so much
as the length of the voyage, he decided to play an
innocent trick upon them by keeping one reckoning
of distance for himself and another for them. He
told them therefore that they had sailed only the
first fifteen miles westward.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>On the twelfth of September, six days after their
departure, they had sailed one hundred and fifty
miles to the west of the Canary Island of Ferro.
On that day they observed the trunk of a great
tree which evidently had been drifting about a
long time. The sailors took it for a sign that land
was not far distant and felt much encouraged, but
the encouragement did not last long, for after sailing
about fifteen miles farther a strange thing happened
which astonished them all and even excited the wondering
Columbus&mdash;the compass needle, which had
steadily pointed to the pole star, changed a whole
degree to the west from its customary direction.
The phenomenon was new to Columbus, as well as
to his sailors. The latter were greatly excited and
declared the earth was out of joint, for the needle no
longer pointed right. The distance which they had
traversed already seemed to them endless
although their leader insisted that he was not a third
of a mile out of his reckoning, but now all seemed
hopeless since the needle, their only guide, had
abandoned them. Columbus, whose ingenuity in
discovering methods of reassuring his weak companions
was inexhaustible, invented a plausible reason
for this unexpected phenomenon which quieted
them though it was far from being satisfactory to
himself. In an ingenious manner he altered the
action of the compass so that the needle pointed
right again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>Hardly had the crew recovered from this shock
before a new trouble arose. They had come to the
region of the trade-winds, which were unknown at
that time. They shuddered as they thought that
if these winds continued to blow they might never
reach home again. One unfortunate thing followed
another. On the sixteenth of September their fear
was greatly increased. They suddenly observed
that the ocean, as far as the eye could reach, was
covered so completely with a green weed that it
seemed as if they were sailing over a vast meadow.<a class="fn" id="fr_14" href="#fn_14">[14]</a>
In some places it was so thick they could hardly
make their way through it. The sailors said to themselves,
&ldquo;We have come to the end of the navigable
ocean. Under this sea-weed there must be reefs
and shallows which will wreck our vessels. Why
should we, wretched unfortunates, longer consent
to follow this foolhardy leader?&rdquo; Columbus again
quieted them and inspired fresh hope. He said to
them, &ldquo;Why should you be troubled about a matter
which shows that we are now approaching the wished-for
goal? Does not vegetation grow by the sea? Is
it not certain that we are not far from the shores
where this sea-weed grew?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The crew was greatly encouraged by his words,
especially as at the same time various birds were
seen flying to the west. Fear changed to hope again
and so they sailed on once more with glad anticipation
of a fortunate end to their undertaking.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="h2line1">Chapter V</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">&ldquo;Land, Land!&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p>The hope which the floating sea-weed and the
flight of birds had aroused among the seamen
soon vanished, for, although they had
now sailed seven hundred and seventy miles to the
west, no land had yet been seen. Fortunately no
one except the Admiral knew how to calculate the
distance. Columbus continued to conceal a considerable
part of it and announced that they had
sailed five hundred and fifty miles.</p>
<p>But even this distance from the fatherland seemed
much too long to them. They began anew to sigh
and groan and murmur, lamented their credulity
in accepting Columbus&rsquo; idle assurances, and uttered
bitter reproaches against Queen Isabella for having
allowed them to risk their lives in such a foolhardy
venture. They resolved that now was the time for
them to return, in case the incessant east wind did
not render it impossible, and that their leader must
be compelled to abandon his scheme. The boldest
among them even advised throwing him overboard,
thereby ridding themselves of such a dangerous
leader, and assured the others that upon their return
to Spain a thorough investigation would justify
them for the death of a man who had toyed with the
lives of so many.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>Columbus realized the danger hanging over him
but was not alarmed. Conscious of the overwhelming
importance of his plans and confiding in
the protection of the Almighty, he appeared among
his sailors like one inspired with success. With
gentle earnestness he rebuked them for their conduct
and sought in every way his knowledge of human
nature suggested to rouse their hopes and courage
anew. At one time he reminded them of their duty
by cordial and flattering appeals; at another he
displayed the masterful authority of a leader and
threatened them with the displeasure of the Queen,
as well as the severest penalties, if they dared to
hold back when so near the successful result of a
glorious achievement.</p>
<p>It is the prerogative of great spirits to bend the
hearts of weaker and ordinary men like wax. He
succeeded in quieting his companions, and the
heavens themselves aided him. The wind, which
hitherto had been persistently east, changed to the
southwest, so that return was impossible even if they
attempted to carry out their purpose. The Admiral
called their attention to this and, as many other
signs of land appeared, fresh hope was awakened
and they sailed on once more in the name of God.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>On the twenty-fifth of September Martin Alonzo
Pinzon, commander of the <i>Pinta</i>, which was in the
lead, came alongside of the Admiral&rsquo;s vessel and
informed him he believed land was only about
fifteen miles away to the north. At the word &ldquo;land&rdquo;
the greatest excitement prevailed. They thanked
God by singing a <i>Gloria in Excelsis</i> and begged the
Admiral to change his course and sail to the northward.
But Columbus was convinced Pinzon was
in error and would not change. He persisted in
carrying out his plan to keep steadily to the west
and the result proved he was correct.</p>
<p>On the following day a multitude of birds were
seen, which convinced Columbus that they had not
flown far and that they were evidences of the land
he was rapidly approaching. The plummet, however,
indicated a depth of two hundred fathoms
which conflicted with his conviction, for the depth of
the sea should diminish with approach to shore. On
the following evening singing birds lit on the masts,
remaining there all night, and flying toward the
west at daybreak. Shortly after this they saw a
new and remarkable sight&mdash;a school of flying-fish
skimming the surface of the water. Some of them
fell upon the decks and were picked up by the seamen,
who curiously noted the long fins which answer
for wings. On the same day the sea was covered
with weeds, another hopeful sign that land was
near. But the goal seemed to recede day by day,
and the higher their expectations were raised the
greater was their disappointment in not realizing
them. The spirit of unrest and even mutiny broke
out anew on all three vessels, and even the officers
sided with the crews against the Admiral.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>Threatened upon every side and forsaken by all,
Columbus stood amidst the tumult of his excited
companions like a lone oak in the tempest and composedly
faced the fury of the mutineers who desired
his death, or, what was tenfold worse than death,
the abandonment of his project. Once more he
employed every resource to quiet them but it was
useless. They cursed him and threatened death if
he did not at once return to the fatherland. In
these desperate circumstances he at last realized the
necessity of compromising with them. Accordingly
he promised that he would yield to their demands if
they would obey his orders three days longer.
Should he not discover land by that time he would
take them back to Spain. Great as was their anger
against their leader, they had to acknowledge the
fairness of the proposition and the agreement was
made.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>In the meantime Columbus was certain that he
could not lose, for the signs of land were so numerous
he was confident he should reach it by the end of the
stipulated time. For several days the plummet had
shown decreasing depth and the kind of earth it
brought up could only come from the near land.
Whole flocks of birds, which were not capable of
long flights, flew to the west. Floating branches
covered with fresh red berries were observed, the air
grew milder, and the wind, especially at night, was
very changeable. So assured was the Admiral now
of success that on the following evening he reminded
the crew of their duty of gratitude to God for their
protection on this dangerous voyage, and ordered
that they should lay to, as he was anxious not to
make a landing at night. He also reminded them
of the Queen&rsquo;s promise of a bounty of ten thousand
<i>maravedis</i> to the one who first discovered land, and
promised to add a like sum to it. The crew remained
on deck all night watching with anxiously
beating hearts for a sight of land.</p>
<p>It was two hours before midnight when Columbus,
standing on the quarter-deck, thought that he saw
a light in the distance. He called one of the royal
pages and pointed it out to him as well as to another
who accompanied him. All three noticed that the
light moved from one place to another and they
decided it must be carried by some traveller.
Columbus was so delighted with this certain proof
that his great journey was at an end that he did not
close his eyes that night.</p>
<p>About two hours after midnight on Friday,
October 12, the loud shout of &ldquo;Land, land!&rdquo; was sent
up on the <i>Pinta</i>, which was in the advance, and all
hearts were rejoiced. Between fear and hope they
waited for the dawn to convince them it was not a
dream. Every minute seemed an hour, every hour
a day. At last the eastern sky began to glow. The
sun rose in splendor and all together the crew of the
<i>Pinta</i> with joyous voices sang, &ldquo;Lord, God, we praise
Thee.&rdquo; Those on the other vessels joined with them
in their thankful outburst as the long-looked-for land
lay before their eyes.</p>

<p class="caption"><i>IN SIGHT OF THE NEW WORLD</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>Hardly had the song of gratitude ended when they
bethought themselves of the duty they owed their
commander. With overflowing hearts and tearful
eyes they prostrated themselves at his feet and
implored his pardon. Wonderful as his steadfastness
had been when confronting their fury, still more
wonderful was his composure as he overlooked their
behavior and promised to forget it.</p>

<h2 id="c6"><span class="h2line1">Chapter VI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Columbus Discovers Several Islands, among them Guanahani, Cuba, and Haiti&mdash;Traffic with the Natives</span></h2>
<p>Columbus first landed upon one of the islands
commonly known as the Bahamas.<a class="fn" id="fr_15" href="#fn_15">[15]</a> One of
them is called Guanahani, and this is the one
first discovered. Columbus named it San Salvador,
the Island of Deliverance, but it is no longer known
by that name. The delighted mariners stood for
some time and gazed with astonished eyes at a
part of the world they had never seen before,
now brightly illuminated by the rising sun. They
could hardly satisfy themselves with the sight of
this smiling, fruitful land, interspersed with beautiful
forests and gracefully winding streams. Columbus
ordered the boats lowered and, stepping into one,
was rowed ashore, with banners flying, to the sound
of martial music, followed by his leaders and an
armed force. As they neared the shore they observed
a great crowd of natives, who gazed with
surprise at the European vessels lying together off
the beach. When they reached land, Columbus,
richly clad, with drawn sword in hand, was the first
to step upon the soil of the New World discovered
by him. His companions knelt, kissed the ground,
and, still kneeling, vowed obedience to their great
leader, now Vice-king of the new country. After
this expression of their joy they set up a crucifix
on the shore and, kneeling before it, offered thanks
to God for His mercy. Then with the customary
ceremonial they took possession in the name of the
King and Queen of Spain.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic4">
<img src="images/p5.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="409" />
<p class="caption"><i>LANDING OF COLUMBUS</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>During these ceremonies the natives crowded
around the Spaniards, gazing in mute astonishment
now upon the vessels and again upon the extraordinary
beings who had come from them. They saw
but knew not what they were seeing, for of all the
ceremonies going on before their eyes they understood
not one. Had these poor creatures known
what was in store for them they would have filled
the air with lamentations or have shed their innocent
blood in defending themselves against these strangers
whom they now regarded with admiration and awe.
The longer they stood and gazed the more incomprehensible
was everything they saw and heard.
The white faces of the Europeans, their beards,
their costume, their weapons, and their actions were
strange to them. As they heard the roar of cannon
and rattle of musketry they huddled together as if
seeking shelter from a thunder storm. They thought
that these strangers, armed with thunder and
lightning, were not human but superhuman beings,
children of their divinity, the sun, who had condescended
to visit the earth. Some of them regarded
the sun, the all-animating, mighty, and beneficent
orb, as God himself. Others believed in many
deities with human figures, and the rest were so
weak mentally that they had no idea of the origin
of the world and no knowledge of its daily phenomena.
These poor creatures knew nothing of
a God and lived in ignorance of whence they came
or of what was to become of them. The Spaniards
in their turn were as greatly astonished at
what they beheld as the natives. The shrubs, plants,
and trees were totally unlike those of Europe.
The natives seemed to be of an entirely different
race from them in their physical appearance and
manner of life. They were of a dark copper color,
their hair was black and long, their chins beardless,
their stature medium, their features strange
and peculiar, their manner gentle, and their bodies
strangely marked and painted. Some were almost&mdash;others
completely&mdash;naked, except that they wore
ornaments of feathers, shells, and disks of gold in
their ears and noses and upon their heads. At
first they were afraid, but after a little, when they
were given presents of beads, ribbons, and other
trifles, they felt so much confidence in their celestial
guests that toward evening, when the Spaniards
returned to their vessels, many of them accompanied
them in little canoes, hollowed out of the
trunks of trees, some to gratify their curiosity still
further, others to exchange gifts. They gave the
Spaniards cotton yarn, which they were skilled in
making, arrows with tips made of fish bone, fruits,
and parrots of various kinds. They were so eager
to get the European trifles that they gathered the
pieces of broken knick-knacks lying upon the deck
and gladly exchanged twenty-five pounds of cotton
yarn for a couple of copper coins which were of no
use to them. The novelty of these articles and the
fact that they belonged to the white people invested
them with great value in their esteem.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>On the next day Columbus went ashore again,
everywhere followed by the natives. He was specially
anxious to find out where the gold came
from. They assured him it was not on their island
but farther south. He decided to act upon this
information, for he had assured the King of Spain
and his avaricious Court that his discoveries would
enrich them. Consequently he went on board again,
took seven natives with him as guides, and sailed
southward. He observed several new islands but
visited only the three largest, which he named Santa
Maria del Concepcion, Ferdinand, and Isabella.
But he found no gold there. Every one he asked
declared it could be found farther south, so he remained
there no longer but sailed south again.
After a comparatively short voyage he discerned a
country different from any he had yet seen, not
only in size but in general character. It was not
level like the others but had many mountains and
valleys, forests, brooks, and rivers. He was in doubt
whether it was part of the mainland or a large island.
After several days&rsquo; observations he was convinced
it was an island, called by the natives Cuba. He
came to anchor at the mouth of a large river, as he was
anxious to get a near view of the people and their
country. All of them fled to the mountains at sight
of the vessels, leaving their cabins empty. Only
one of them had the courage to row out in a small
skiff and go aboard. After his confidence had been
secured by some little gifts, Columbus sent two
Spaniards and one of the natives of Guanahani whom
he had taken with him to learn something about the
region and conciliate the natives, for he was very
anxious they should not flee every time they saw
the vessels. The two Spaniards proceeded inland
about twelve miles and upon their return submitted
the following report to the Admiral:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>&ldquo;We found a great part of the country under cultivation
and exceedingly productive. Indian corn or
maize and a kind of root, which, when baked, tastes
like bread, grows in the fields. We came at last to
a village of at least fifty wooden dwellings and about
a thousand people. The leaders came out to meet
us and when they heard we had natives on board
and what kind of people we were, they embraced us
and conducted us to their largest house. We sat
upon chairs shaped like an animal, its tail serving
for the back and its eyes and ears fashioned of gold.
When we were seated the natives sat near us on the
floor, kissed our hands and feet, and paid us such
homage it was easy to see they thought we were
superhuman and celestial beings. They gave us
to eat of their baked root, which had the flavor of
chestnuts. We noticed that all who waited upon us
were men. After a little they withdrew and several
women entered, who bestowed the same marks of
homage as the men. When at last we made ready
to return, many of the natives asked permission to
accompany us, but we declined, taking with us only
the King and his son, who have come with us as a
special mark of honor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Admiral expressed his gratitude to the two
and entertained them on board his vessel most
hospitably. In reply to inquiries as to the locality
of the gold country they pointed to the east, but
could not understand why white men should be so
eager to find a metal which to them was valueless
except as an ornament. The whites wondered still
more at the simplicity of these people. Columbus
shortened his stay, as he was anxious to start in the
direction they had indicated and search for the
much coveted gold in a country which was called
Haiti by the natives.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>Columbus left Cuba November 19 and took
twelve of the natives with him with the intention
of carrying them to Spain when he returned. They
left their fatherland without much regret, for he
had left nothing undone to make their condition
agreeable. As the winds were contrary and Columbus&rsquo;
large vessel could make only slow progress,
Alonzo Pinzon, captain of the <i>Pinta</i>, having the
swiftest of the ships, determined to slip away from
the Admiral, get to the gold country first, and fill
his sacks before the rest got there. Columbus
knew Pinzon&rsquo;s purpose and signalled him to wait, but
Pinzon paid no heed and sailed away as fast as he
could to satisfy his greed for gold.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>The Admiral had to submit to what he could not
change but, as it soon became so stormy that it was
dangerous to keep out to sea, he was forced to
return to Cuba and anchor again in a secure harbor.
He passed the time in making closer observations
of the country and the natives. He noticed one
peculiarity in their eating, which at first disgusted
the Spaniards. They were particularly fond of a
kind of large spider, worms which they found in
rotting wood, and half cooked fish, which they ate
ravenously. After a little some of the Spaniards
tried to eat them but had to abandon the experiment.
As soon as the weather favored, Columbus
started anew to seek for Haiti and his faithless
comrade, Pinzon. He had but sixteen miles to go
and was soon there. He arrived at Haiti December
6, and named the island Hispaniola, or Little Spain.
Upon his arrival the natives fled to the woods and
nothing was seen or heard of the <i>Pinta</i>. The Admiral
shortly left the harbor into which he had run
and began a cruise along the coast to the north. He
soon reached another harbor and there his desire
to get acquainted with the natives was gratified.
In general appearance and habits they resembled
the natives of Guanahani and Cuba. They went
unclad, were copper colored, and were simple, gentle,
and ignorant like the others. They also thought
the Spaniards were not human but celestial beings.
They wore more gold ornaments than the others
and cared so little for gold that they willingly
exchanged it for beads, pins, bells, and other trifles.
But when Columbus inquired for the place where it
was to be found, they pointed to the east, so once
more he set sail in the hope of finding the source of
this inexhaustible treasure.</p>

<br /><span class="h2line2">Prince Guakanahari&mdash;The Admiral&rsquo;s Vessel Wrecked&mdash;Forty-three Men Remain Behind&mdash;The Return Voyage Begins</span></h2>
<p>While the ships were lying at anchor in an
inlet of the same island of Hispaniola the
cacique who ruled that region heard of the
arrival of these wonderful white men and condescended
to make the Admiral a visit. His retinue
was quite imposing. He himself was borne in a
litter by four men, his princely body almost as destitute
of clothing as those of his dependents.</p>
<p>The cacique went on board without the slightest
hesitation and, observing that the Admiral was
seated at table, entered the cabin, accompanied by
two old men who appeared to be his councillors,
and sat down familiarly but respectfully by the side
of Columbus, the old men reclining at his feet.
The Admiral offered him food and wine, which he
tasted, sending what was left to his people on deck.
After the meal was finished he presented the Admiral
with some gold ornaments and a skilfully made girdle,
Columbus, in turn, presenting him a string of amber
beads and a pair of red slippers, besides a rug and
a flask of orange-flower water. The cacique was so
delighted that he assured Columbus everything in
his country was at Columbus&rsquo; disposal.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>The attitude of the cacique toward his own people
was very stately but with the Spaniards he was
quite familiar. He paid close attention to everything
and expressed great admiration for all that
he saw. Toward evening he expressed the desire
to go ashore again. His wish was gratified and, the
more deeply to impress him, the Admiral saluted
his departure with cannon. Thereupon he declared
they must be of heavenly origin for they could
control the thunder and lightning. The awe with
which his servants regarded them was so great that
they kissed the footprints left by the Spaniards.
As the cacique&rsquo;s country, however, did not contain
the rich gold mines, which were now the only object
of Columbus&rsquo; quest, he weighed anchor again and
sailed still farther eastward.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>All the information received by Columbus was
to the effect that the gold was in a mountainous
country ruled by a powerful cacique. Thither he
hastened but, had he known of the serious disaster
which was to happen on his short voyage, he would
have given up the gold itself rather than pay such
a heavy cost for the effort of finding it. On this
voyage they came to a cape, where the sea was so
calm they might easily have anchored a short distance
from shore. He had not slept for two days and
nature at last claimed her rights. Entrusting the
tiller to a helmsman, he urged him to be careful, and
went below to take a little rest. Hardly had he
fallen asleep before the careless sailors imitated his
example, deserted their posts, and went to sleep
also. Even the helmsman, who thought there was
no danger in such quiet waters, disregarded his superior&rsquo;s
orders, turned his duties over to an ignorant
cabin-boy, and went to sleep. This boy was
the only one awake on the vessel. While all were
sleeping the ship was driven by a strong current
toward the shore. A sudden shock forced the tiller
from the boy&rsquo;s hands. Awakened by his shouts,
Columbus rushed upon deck, saw the rocks, and
instantly knew that the vessel had struck upon them.
There was immediate confusion. Columbus alone
kept his presence of mind and made preparations
to save the vessel. He ordered a boat&rsquo;s crew to
drop anchor at some distance away so that they
might, if possible, warp it off the rocks. The boat&rsquo;s
crew were so frightened, however, that his orders
were not obeyed. They thought only of their own
safety and rowed to the <i>Nina</i>. Its commander,
however, refused to take on board the men who had
been so forgetful of duty as to leave their commander
in the lurch. Columbus in the meantime cut the
masts and threw everything overboard that was
useless, hoping to lighten the vessel, but its keel
was split and the water poured in so fast and continuously
that at length the Admiral and crew
abandoned it and rowed to the <i>Nina</i>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>On the next morning he sent a message to the
cacique telling him of the disaster which had
occurred and asking the assistance of his people in
saving the valuables on board the wrecked vessel.
The cacique, whose name was Guakanahari, was
greatly distressed by the news and, shedding tears
over it, hastened to the relief of the unfortunate
Europeans, accompanied by many of his people.</p>
<p>These kindly natives did not improve the opportunity
to steal but exerted themselves to the utmost
to save everything. They collected a number of
canoes and, by their united exertions, everything of
importance was taken ashore. The noble Guakanahari
took charge of the valuables and from time
to time sent one of his kinsmen, who implored Columbus
with tearful eyes not to grieve, for the cacique
would give him all he had if it were necessary. The
latter took the valuables to his own house and
stationed a strong guard to watch them until they
should be needed by Columbus, although it seemed
unnecessary, for the natives deplored the disaster
as keenly as if it had happened to themselves. In
the report which Columbus made to the Court of
Spain he paid a glowing tribute to these noble
natives. &ldquo;In reality, Your Majesty,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;these people are so gentle and peaceful, I can
assure you there can be no better people in the
world. They love their neighbors as themselves.
Their demeanor is always pleasant and agreeable.
They are invariably cheerful and kind and they
speak to you with a smile. Though it is true that
they go naked, Your Majesty may be assured
that they are modest and exemplary in their habits.
Their King is treated with the highest respect and
he himself is so noble and generous that it is a great
pleasure to have known him. He and his people
will always live in my pleasant memory.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>When Guakanahari discovered how fond of gold
the Europeans were, he made them many golden
presents to console them for their misfortune and
promised to get more for them from a place he called
Cibao.<a class="fn" id="fr_16" href="#fn_16">[16]</a> Many of his people also brought gold and
were delighted to exchange it for European knick-knacks.
One of them, holding a large piece in one
hand, extended the other to a Spaniard, who placed
a bell in it. The native dropped the gold and fled,
thinking he had cheated the white man and would
be looked upon as a thief.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>The Spaniards now began to enjoy their stay
there but in the meantime Columbus was harassed
by anxiety night and day. His best vessel was lost.
The faithless Pinzon had deserted him. The only
one of his vessels left was so small and poorly built
that it would not accommodate his men nor was it
sufficiently seaworthy for the long return voyage.
At last he decided that he would take a few men and
try to go back, notwithstanding all dangers, so that
the news of his discovery should reach the Court,
and leave the others as colonists in Hispaniola. His
decision was universally approved and a sufficient
number expressed their willingness to remain. The
cacique was greatly pleased when he learned that
the celestial visitants were going to remain and
protect him and his people against their enemies.
According to his statement a savage, warlike race,
called Caribs, lived on certain islands to the southeast.
From time to time, he asserted, his country
was invaded by them and, as his people were too
weak to resist them and dared not remain in their
vicinity, they had to flee to the mountains.<a class="fn" id="fr_17" href="#fn_17">[17]</a></p>
<p>Columbus promised to protect them and, to impress
them with his power, ordered his people to
perform some military man&oelig;uvres in their presence.
They were greatly astonished, but when the cannon
which had been taken off the wrecked vessel were
fired, they were so frightened that they threw themselves
upon the ground and covered their faces.
Guakanahari himself was greatly alarmed and his
fear was not allayed until Columbus assured him
that the thunder should harm only his enemies.
That he might fully realize its destructive effect he
aimed a cannon at the wrecked vessel and fired.
The ball went through it and struck the water on
the other side. This sight so amazed the cacique
that he went home, being firmly convinced his guests
were from the skies and that they controlled the
thunder and lightning.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>Several days were now spent in the erection of a
small fort and the kindly natives lent all possible
assistance, little dreaming, however, that they were
forging the fetters which one day would bind them.
Whenever the Admiral was on shore the cacique
lavished favors upon him which he generously
requited. Once he received Columbus with a
golden crown on his head and conducted him to a
richly decorated house. Then he took off the crown
and with great reverence placed it upon Columbus.
The latter took a necklace of small pearls which he
was wearing and placed it around the cacique&rsquo;s
neck. Then he took off his handsome cloak and put
it on the Prince, and placed a silver ring upon his
finger. Not content with this, he drew off a pair
of red buskins and gave them to him. With this
interchange of tokens of good-will a bond of friendship
was established between them.</p>
<p>The fort was finished in ten days and Columbus
selected forty-three men who were to garrison it
under command of the nobleman, Diego de Cerana.
He ordered them to render him absolute obedience
to preserve the good-will of Guakanahari and his
people in every way and to acquaint themselves with
their language. The place where he left them he
named La Navidad.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>After this, Columbus went on board the little
vessel and on January 4, 1493, weighed anchor. A
bold venture! In a small, unseaworthy vessel he
determined to recross the vast and still little
known ocean. To remove every vestige of doubt
at the suspicious Court and convince the King of
the truth of his discoveries, he took with him as
evidence not only gold but several of the natives,
besides unknown birds of various species. On
his voyage eastward he kept his course for some
time along the coast of Hispaniola to get a view of
the adjacent region. On the second day he saw a
vessel in the distance. He at once sailed in its
direction and found it to be the vessel of the faithless
Pinzon, of which he had had no trace for six
weeks. Pinzon came on board and tried to convince
Columbus it was all the fault of stormy weather
which had driven him out to sea. Columbus knew
this was false but, naturally magnanimous, he
affected to believe it and took him into his favor,
highly pleased that the results of his great discoveries
no longer depended upon the safety of one small
vessel. Pinzon also had been cruising along the
coast of Hispaniola but in a different direction,
bartering for gold.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="h2line1">Chapter VIII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">The Return Voyage&mdash;Storm on the Way&mdash;Arrival at the Azores, Lisbon, and Palos</span></h2>
<p>A fresh west wind, which fortunately had
sprung up, carried the vessels swiftly along
and the joyful crews already fancied themselves
in Spain telling their astonished listeners the
story of the wonders of the New World. Then
suddenly a storm cloud arose in the western sky.
The storm rapidly approached. It grew darker
and darker and the frightened sailors, in anxious
expectancy of what might happen, stood around the
deck watching the Admiral who, with his customary
composure, issued the necessary orders.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>Now the waves of the broad ocean began to rise,
the vessels were tossed about, the cordage rattled,
and the wind howled fearfully through the rigging.
It lightened, then again was dark as night. It
thundered and a tempest of rain beat upon the
tossing vessels. The storm burst upon them in
all its fury. The lightning flashed, the thunders
crashed, the waves rushed along, the winds howled,
and the reeling vessels were now hurled high in air
by the mighty billows and now plunged into deep
abysses. The sailors were overcome with fear.
Some of them fell upon their knees and prayed with
uplifted hands that their lives might be spared.
Others stood or lay prostrate, paralyzed with fright,
and appeared more dead than alive; still others
sought shelter in superstitions and promised if
Heaven would save them they would make a barefooted
pilgrimage to some church dedicated to the
Virgin in the first Christian country they reached.
They were really in a desperate plight. They swung
as it were between death and life and every mountainous
wave which lifted them upon its mighty
crest and hurled them down again into the watery
abyss seemed to them the messenger of their doom.
In vain Columbus sought to employ every means
of safety suggested by his skill and experience; in
vain he tried to encourage them and to rouse them
to activity. They were soulless bodies capable of
no effort while the storm raged on with irresistible
fury. At last, when he was convinced that human
help was impossible, he betook himself with sorrowing
heart to his cabin to provide in some way that his
great discoveries should not be lost to the world.
Nothing troubled him so much as the thought
that the important intelligence he was taking to
Europe might be lost. It pierced his great heart
like a sharp two-edged sword and moved him to
think not so much of himself and his own safety
as of some means to avert what in his estimation
was the greatest of calamities. With death staring
him in the face this unterrified man was still capable
of thinking clearly and quietly, of formulating concise
decisions, and putting them into effect.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>Columbus took a parchment, inscribed upon it
an account of his discoveries, wrapped it in oilcloth
and sealed it with wax. This packet he placed
in a well protected cask and threw it into the ocean,
hoping it would be washed ashore where some one
was living who would open it and thus become
acquainted with his discoveries. Some time after
this he fastened a second cask with a similar package
to the stern of his vessel so that it should go
with him if the vessel went down with him and his
people.</p>
<p>In the meantime, to increase the terror of the
frightful death which menaced the crew every moment,
the darkest and most cruel of all nights came
on. No mild stars, such as bring hope to the despairing,
shone in the heavens. Sky and sea were enveloped
in dense darkness and the raging hurricane
continued without the least abatement of its fury.
Thus they alternated between life and death, only
half alive. But the dreadful night passed at last
and in the first glimmer of dawn, to the unspeakable
delight of the wretched crew, land was seen in the
distance. The Azores lay before their eyes but, as
the storm had not yet abated, Columbus could not
get near the shore. They had longed for a speedy
landing but, in view of the danger, they found it
necessary to hold off for four days. The <i>Pinta</i>
had disappeared and it was uncertain whether it
had gone down or whether Pinzon had taken advantage
of the storm and the darkness to forsake the
Admiral and reach Spain with the first news of the
discoveries. At last the storm subsided and Columbus
lost no time in coming to anchor. Several
Portuguese came to the vessel and offered food for
sale and inquired whence they had come and whither
they proposed to go.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>Learning from them that there was an oratory of
the Virgin not far from the shore, Columbus permitted
half of his men to land and fulfil the promise
they had made. He himself had grown lame in
both hips owing to his long watching and painful
exertions and had to remain on board, but he ordered
them to return as soon as possible so that the others
might go ashore and perform their vows also. They
promised to obey him, disrobed themselves, and went
barefooted to the oratory. Several hours passed but
none of them came back. He waited hour after
hour but no one appeared. At last it was night
and still no one came. He grew suspicious but,
to learn the true state of affairs, had to wait until
morning. Morning came and then he was astonished
to discover that the Portuguese had overpowered
the pilgrims and placed them under arrest.
Columbus was extremely indignant at this treacherous
conduct and, as his protests were useless, he at
last threatened that he would not sail until he had
taken a hundred Portuguese prisoners and laid
waste the island. His threat made an impression
upon them. They sent messengers to inquire in the
name of the governor whether he and his vessels
were in the service of the Spanish court. When
Columbus had convinced them of this by his letter
of credentials they released the prisoners. The governor,
it is said, had instructions from his King to
seize the person of Columbus, if he could, and imprison
him and his people and then quietly take
possession of the countries discovered by him. But as
this could not be done, because Columbus remained
on board, he thought it wiser to give up the prisoners
and pretend that they had not known they were
Spaniards. Delighted with the fortunate settlement
of this troublesome business, Columbus again set sail,
pleased with the prospect that all hardships and dangers
were ended. But Heaven had decreed that his
steadfastness must once more be tested.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>The fearful storm broke out anew, the vessel was
driven from its course, the sails were torn, the masts
wavered, and at every shock of the waves the despairing
crew expected to be lost. In this desperate
condition, which had now lasted two days, the crew
suddenly perceived rocks, upon which the old and
shattered vessel was being driven. Had it continued
in that direction a moment longer it would have
been destroyed, but Columbus&rsquo; presence of mind
did not forsake him in this appalling crisis. A
skilful turn which he made at just the right time
saved the vessel and all on board. He soon recognized
that he was on the Portuguese coast and
certainly at the mouth of the Tagus, so he decided
to come to anchor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>At daybreak he sent messengers, one to Madrid
to notify the King of Spain of his safe arrival, the
other to the King of Portugal at Lisbon to ask permission
to come up the Tagus to the city and repair
his vessel. Permission being granted, he sailed
without delay to Lisbon. The news of the approach
of the famous vessel rapidly spread through the
city, and all who could, ran to the harbor. The
shore was crowded with people and the river with
boats, for every one was eager to see the wonderful
man who had achieved such an extraordinary undertaking.
Some thanked God for the favor He had
shown the bold navigator, others deplored the misfortune
of their fatherland in rejecting his services.
The King of Portugal himself could not now refuse
to pay his respects to Columbus notwithstanding his
deep regret that by this man&rsquo;s discoveries Spain
would greatly increase its power and secure possessions
which, but for the folly of his advisers, he
might have had. He ordered his subjects to pay
Columbus all possible honor, to provide his men with
subsistence, and also wrote a very complimentary
letter, inviting him to call upon him. Columbus
hastened to accept the royal invitation. Upon his
arrival the entire Court, by command of the King,
went out to meet him. During the interview the
King insisted that Columbus should speak sitting,
and with covered head, and displayed a lively interest
in the account of the discoveries and sought
by flattering appeals to induce him to engage in his
service. It was in vain, however. He might have
offered him half of his kingdom without causing
him to waver in his devotion to the Court to which
he had dedicated his services. After a courteous
withdrawal and the necessary repairs to his vessel
he again set sail for the same Spanish port (March
15) which he had left seven months and eleven
days before.</p>

<br /><span class="h2line2">Columbus&rsquo; Second Journey in 1493&mdash;Several Islands Discovered&mdash;The Spaniards Find their Fort Destroyed and the Colonists Dead</span></h2>
<p>Hardly had the news of Columbus&rsquo; approach
reached Palos before the people
rushed to the harbor to see with their own
eyes whether it was true. As the vessel drew near
and they recognized upon its deck, one his son,
another his brother, a third his friend, and a fourth
her husband, a universal outburst of joy rent the
air, thousands of arms were outstretched in welcome
to the loved strangers, and thousands more shed
tears of joy.</p>
<p>As Columbus stepped ashore he was greeted by
the roar of cannon, the jubilant clang of bells, and
the enthusiastic shouts of the multitude. Unmoved
by what would have turned the heads of ordinary
men, he made it his first duty to declare that the
fortunate outcome of his great undertaking was due
not to himself but to God. He went immediately to
the church in which he had implored the divine favor
before his departure, accompanied by his sailors
and all the people. After publicly acknowledging
his obligations to the Almighty, he proceeded to
Barcelona, a city in Catalonia, where the King and
Queen of Spain were holding Court. Pinzon had
arrived at another Spanish port several days before
Columbus, with the intention of being the first to
announce the news to the Court, but the King had
ordered him not to appear except in the company
of Columbus. Thereupon the conceited Pinzon was
so disappointed that he fell ill and died in a few days.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>At every place along his route Columbus was
welcomed by extraordinary multitudes from the
neighboring regions and heard his name pass admiringly
from mouth to mouth. At last he reached
Barcelona, where the King and Queen impatiently
awaited him. The whole Court household went
out to pay him honor. The streets were so densely
crowded that it was almost impossible for him to
make his way. The procession moved in the following
order: Several Indians, in their native costumes,
whom Columbus had taken with him, were in the
advance; behind them, men carried the gold plates,
gold-dust, and gold ornaments which he had brought;
then followed others with samples of the products
of the newly discovered region, such as balls of cotton
yarn, chests of pepper, parrots carried upon long
reeds, stuffed animals, and a multitude of other
objects which had never been seen in Europe before;
at last came Columbus himself, the cynosure of all
eyes.</p>

<p class="caption"><i>THE RETURN OF COLUMBUS FROM HIS FIRST VOYAGE</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>To pay especial honor to Columbus Their Majesties
had caused a magnificent throne to be erected in
the public square where they awaited him. As
he approached them with the intention of kneeling
as usual at the foot of the throne, the King extended
his hand to him to be kissed and requested him to
sit by his side upon a chair placed there for him.
Thereupon he modestly told the story of his discoveries
and displayed the proofs of them in the
objects he had brought. When he had finished his
story, both Their Majesties and the multitude of
assembled spectators knelt and thanked God that
these great discoveries, so rich in advantage to
Spain, had been made in their day. Thereupon
all the honors which Columbus had asked as reward
were granted. He and his whole family were ennobled,
and whenever the King rode out, the much-loved
Admiral rode at his bridle, an honor which
up to that time had been enjoyed only by princes
and the royal family. But what pleased him most
was the royal order that an entire fleet for a second
expedition should be equipped.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>In the meantime the King sent an ambassador to
Rome praying the Pope that he would confirm the
Spaniards in possession of the newly discovered
regions and all that might yet be discovered by them
in the ocean. The Pope, Alexander VI, drew upon a
globe a line of demarcation from one pole to another,
at a distance of a hundred miles from the Azores,
and issued a bull declaring that all land discovered
beyond that line should belong to Spain. At that
time it was the rule that a prince could hold possession
of a newly discovered country only when
the Pope, as the divine representative upon earth,
had confirmed it.</p>
<p>The fleet was fitted out so rapidly that in a short
time seventeen excellent vessels waited at Cadiz in
readiness to sail. The desire to secure possessions
and honor induced an incredible number of men of
all classes to apply for participation in the expedition,
but Columbus, not being able to accommodate all
of them, selected fifteen hundred and paid special
attention to the provisioning of the fleet and the
procuring of all articles necessary to colonization.
All sorts of implements were provided, besides animals
unknown in the new world, such as horses,
mules, and cows, all the European species of corn, and
seeds of many herbs and plants which he believed
would grow in that latitude. As he still labored
under the delusion that the region discovered by
him was a part of India, he gave it the name of West
Indies to distinguish it from the real India, because
to reach it he had to sail west from Europe. The
Indies lying to the eastward were at that time called
the East Indies.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>Everything being ready, the fleet set sail from Cadiz
September 25, 1493. Columbus at first directed his
course toward the Canary Islands and arrived there
October 5. There he took aboard fresh water, wood,
and cattle, besides some swine, and set sail again from
Ferro, October 13. In twenty days, aided by favoring
winds, the fleet had covered a distance of eight
hundred miles. On the second of November,
thirty-six days after their departure from Spain, the
fleet came to anchor off an island which Columbus
named Dominica, because he discovered it on the
Sunday which in the later Latin was called &ldquo;Dies
Dominica,&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Day of the Lord.&rdquo; Dominica is
one of the Lesser Antilles or Caribbean Islands. As
he could not find good anchorage there he sailed
farther on and shortly discovered several other
islands, some of them of considerable size, such as
Marie Galante, Guadeloupe, Antigua, Porto Rico,
and St. Martin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>Upon Guadeloupe they observed a magnificent
waterfall plunging over a lofty and jagged cliff with
a roar that could be heard three miles away. At
first no natives were visible, as they had deserted
their huts and fled to the mountains. At last some
of the Spaniards who had been sent out brought in
two boys who asserted they were not born on the
island but had been forcibly carried away, by these
natives, from a neighboring island. Soon six women
were found who piteously implored help, saying that
they had been seized and condemned to slavery.
The dreadful news was learned from them that the
natives of this island were in the habit of roasting
and eating male prisoners taken in their battles,
and that the women were carried off by them notwithstanding
their piteous appeals. Columbus
found that what these women and the cacique,
Guakanahari, had told him previously of the barbarous
practices of these islanders, was true. Almost
everywhere that he landed he met with a
hostile reception and everywhere he found traces
of the inhuman practice of cannibalism. With horror
they saw the bones and skulls of slaughtered
human beings lying around almost every dwelling.
This and his desire as soon as possible to
gladden the Spaniards who had been left at Hispaniola,
induced Columbus not to remain longer
at these newly discovered islands, especially as it
was useless to try to communicate with the natives.
He resumed his voyage therefore and, on
the twenty-first of the same month, safely arrived
at a spot which was only a day&rsquo;s journey from
Fort Navidad.</p>
<p>Some of the crew sent ashore returned with the
alarming news that they had found the dead bodies
of two men on the beach fastened to a piece of
wood in the shape of a cross. They could not decide
whether they were Europeans or natives as decomposition
had made them unrecognizable. This
news made Columbus anxious as to what might
be disclosed on the following day. He passed a
restless night and as soon as the morning broke
hastened to discover whether his fears were groundless
or not. As he approached the heights of La
Navidad he sprang into a boat and was rowed to
the shore. How great was his astonishment not to
find the Spaniards he had left there nor the fort
they had erected, only some fragments of it, torn
clothes, broken weapons, and utensils! The sight
told him all and, as further evidence of the dreadful
fate of the vanished colonists, eleven corpses were
found a little distance away, showing the signs of
murder. As they were deploring the fate of these
unfortunates and considering plans of revenge, the
brother of Guakanahari met them and gave them a
detailed account of the calamity.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>It was substantially as follows: Hardly had
Columbus sailed when the men left behind disregarded
the excellent advice and the instructions
he had given them. Instead of treating the natives
in a kindly manner they became so unjust and
practised so many excesses that the natives, who had
regarded these white men as celestial visitors, found
that they not only were not better but were much
worse than the dark-skinned men. The white
commander attempted to restrain them but they
paid no heed to his orders or his warnings, refused
to obey him, and overran the island, committing
robberies and deeds of violence. At last they began
to ravage the territory of the cacique of Cibao, where
the gold was found. Infuriated by their atrocities,
he and his people at last took up arms and overpowered
them, then surrounded the fort and fired
it. Some of the Spaniards were killed in its defence,
others took to their boats but were soon drowned.
He further stated that his brother, who had remained
faithful, notwithstanding all these outrages, took
up arms for the Spaniards but received a wound in
a battle with the cacique of Cibao and was still
suffering from it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>Columbus&rsquo; men were eager to take a bloody
revenge but he was too wise and humane to consent
to any such scheme. He tried to convince them how
necessary it was to the safety of this island and the
new colony to conciliate and secure the good-will
of the natives. He visited Guakanahari and found
him still suffering from a wound made not with
European but native weapons. The loyal, steadfast
conduct of the cacique confirmed the truth of
his story. He also sought to convince Columbus
in every possible way of his unswerving loyalty and
presented him with eight hundred little shells upon
which the natives set a high value, besides a hundred
gold plates, and three gourds filled with grains of
gold, for all of which Columbus gave him several
European trifles.</p>
<p>After this, Columbus conducted his people to a
more comfortable and healthier region where, near
the mouth of a little stream, he decided to establish
a regularly fortified city in which those remaining
would have a safe and convenient dwelling-place.
No one was allowed to be an idle spectator. By
the united efforts of so many hands the first little
city built by Europeans in the New World arose and
was named Isabella by Columbus, in honor of his
Queen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="h2line1">Chapter X</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">New Discoveries&mdash;Columbus in Great Danger&mdash;Uprising of the Natives</span></h2>
<p>During the building of the city of Isabella
Columbus had to contend with a thousand
difficulties which only a spirit like his could
overcome. The Spaniards, who were naturally
lazy, became still less inclined to put forth unnecessary
exertion in that hot climate, and loudly protested
against a manner of life the demands of which they
had not foreseen. They had gone there with glowing
expectations of securing great treasures and had
been promised an easy, pleasant life, whereas they
had to toil day after day with hired men in the
blazing sunshine. Again, the unhealthy atmosphere
induced sickness and little by little a deprivation of
those necessities of life which were indispensable to
these European weaklings. Where were the golden
mountains which, it was promised them, they should
visit? They had no chance to go, for the Admiral
was fully determined to complete the work of building
the city before he allowed them to penetrate the
interior of the island.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>These were the causes of the discontent which
increased day by day and at last led to a conspiracy
against the life of Columbus. Fortunately the
fire was discovered while it was still smouldering.
The ringleaders were overpowered, some of them
were punished, and others were sent to Spain to be
made an example of. At the same time Columbus
besought the King to send him speedily reinforcements
of men, besides fresh stocks of provisions.
In the meantime, to remove the dissatisfaction and
quell the mutinous spirit of his men, he allowed a
part of them to make an inland expedition under
command of the chevalier Ojeda, and later he conducted
one himself, to impress the natives with the
sight of a European military force. With this end
in view he marched his men in close ranks, with
banners flying and with field music playing, and also
had his cavalry execute man&oelig;uvres which astonished
the natives who had never seen horses before and
thought horse and rider were one. The Indians
fled to their cabins when they beheld the Spaniards
and imagined themselves secure when they had
fastened the entrances with fragile bamboos. Their
route lay through the gold region of Cibao. All
that the natives had said about this region was
found correct. The mines were not worked, for the
natives would make no effort to find a metal for which
they had no use, but in every stream the Spaniards
found gold grains which the water had loosened
from the mountains and washed down.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>Delighted with their discovery the Spaniards returned
to Isabella. The city was in a wretched plight,
the means of subsistence were fast disappearing, for
the work of building had left no time for cultivating
the land, and sickness was rapidly spreading
in that hot, unhealthy region. Fortunately this
was not the first time Columbus had had to struggle
against difficulties. Previous experience had increased
his skill in overcoming them and the repeated
dangers to which he had been exposed had made
him all the more resolute and steadfast in meeting
each new one. Once more he set about overcoming
these and restoring quiet. As soon as this was
accomplished he decided to go in quest of new
discoveries. Appointing his second brother, Don
Diego, regent, and placing Pedro de Margrite in
command of those remaining behind as captain-general,
he himself, with one large and two small
vessels, or caravels, put out to sea and sailed to the
west. The first important discovery on this voyage
was the island of Jamaica. As soon as he had come
to anchor he sent a boat&rsquo;s crew to ascertain whether
there was sufficient depth of water for him to enter
the harbor. The crew soon encountered a great
number of canoes filled with armed natives who
strove to prevent a landing. As they could not
effect it peaceably they greeted them with such a
shower of arrows that the crew had to retreat.
As the harbor eventually was found secure Columbus
entered it, made some repairs on his vessels, and
spent the rest of the time in examining the country.
Its conditions seemed to him superior to those of
Hispaniola. He made no delay, therefore, in taking
possession of it in the name of the King of Spain.
From there he sailed to Cuba to see whether that
country, previously discovered by him, was an island
or part of the mainland. In doing this he encountered
a succession of dangerous mishaps, compared
with which his previous ones were insignificant.
He met with a terrible storm in the most dangerous
part of a region entirely unknown to him. He found
himself in the midst of rocks and sand bars which
threatened the instant destruction of his vessels.
He also ran into shallows which made his vessels
leak so badly that it required the exertion of his entire
crew at the pumps to keep them from sinking. He
also had to contend with the dangers of hunger and
thirst, and, if by chance they secured subsistence,
he was the last to avail himself of it, as he was more
solicitous for his companions than for himself. He
also had to struggle against the dissatisfaction and
despondency of his men, who assailed him with
reproaches though he had shared so courageously
all their deprivations and dangers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>At various landings which he made in Cuba he
learned from the natives that it was an island. In
some places the air was so full of birds and butterflies
that the sun was obscured and the day was
as dark as if there were a storm. At the north
side of the island they found the ocean thickly filled
with little, low islands, to which he gave the general
name of the Queen&rsquo;s Garden. Among these islands
they met a canoe filled with fishermen who came on
board the Admiral&rsquo;s vessel to make him a present
of their catch. In return Columbus made them
some little presents to ensure their friendship.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>The unceasing and almost superhuman wear of
mind and body at last seriously affected his health.
Utterly exhausted and unable to sleep, he fell into a
lethargy which deprived him of sense and memory.
Fearing that he might not recover, they hastened
to get back to Isabella as best they could. There
he found a remedy for his troubles more potent
then any physicians could provide. His favorite
brother, Bartolomeo, who had been sent by the King
with more men and supplies, had arrived. Thus
he had double cause for joy. These two brothers,
who were devotedly attached to each other and had
similar tastes, had been separated thirteen long years.
Bartolomeo&rsquo;s arrival could not have been more
fortunate. The Admiral&rsquo;s illness and the wretched
condition of affairs at Hispaniola required the services
of just such an intelligent, brave, and experienced
man and, had he not come just when he did, there is
little doubt Columbus and the entire colony would
have perished. This unexpected good fortune not only
worked Columbus&rsquo; recovery but placed him in a position
to prevent the destruction of the new colony.
During his absence everything had been thrown into
confusion. Two-thirds of the colony had fallen
victims to the diseases common in that latitude.
Margrite, who had been made captain-general,
had become a rebel, but as he could not carry out
his purposes, had escaped to Spain upon one of the
vessels with Buil, his fellow-conspirator. The
soldiers under his command were scattered over the
island without a leader and had committed all
kinds of outrages. Because of this the natives had
become embittered toward the Spaniards and had
murdered many of them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>Such were the conditions which threatened the
destruction of the young colony.</p>
<p>The worst of all was the fact that the natives,
hitherto so peaceful and friendly, at last began to
realize the danger which menaced them. Made
wiser by their experiences, they looked into the
future and saw, with a shudder, that a longer stay
of these strangers, whom they at first had reverenced,
meant famine and slavery for them. With the idle
life to which they were accustomed, and in that hot
climate, very little food was required for daily subsistence.
A handful of maize and a little roasted
cassava<a class="fn" id="fr_18" href="#fn_18">[18]</a> were all they needed. Now, they noticed
with surprise, that one Spaniard ate more at one
meal than four of them would eat in a whole day,
from which they concluded that it would not be
long before everything on the island would be consumed
and they would be left victims of hunger.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>These observations and the daily spectacle of
deeds of violence committed by the Spaniards, at
last convinced the natives they must either throw
off the yoke or forever wear it. They had courage
enough to make the attempt. They took up arms
and united themselves under their caciques into a
large army, numbering about one hundred thousand.
Columbus did not shrink before the danger confronting
the colony though he deeply deplored the bitterness
which had been caused among the natives by
the outrages committed by his inferiors. His chief
hope, that these poor and ignorant heathen might
be led to accept the Christian religion, was now
dissipated and he realized that blood must be shed
among those who might have lived together peaceably.
In the midst of these discouragements the
faithful Guakanahari visited him and tendered him
his sympathy and help. This steadfast friend of
the Europeans had already incurred the enmity of
the other caciques for protecting the strangers; and
hence, in self-defence, it became necessary for him
to side with the Spaniards. Columbus cordially
thanked him and accepted the service of his warriors.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">The Natives are Subjugated&mdash;Columbus is Traduced in Spain&mdash;He Returns to Europe and Suffers Many Hardships on the Voyage</span></h2>
<p>With the two armies confronting one another
the time had come which must decide
for either the lives of the Spaniards or the
freedom of the natives. Upon the one side were
a hundred thousand Indians, armed with clubs,
spears, and arrows, the latter tipped with bone or
flint. Upon the other were only two hundred
infantry and twenty cavalrymen, supported by a
small force of Indians under the command of Guakanahari.
The contrast was great, but what the
Europeans lacked in numbers they made up in the
science of war, as well as in their weapons, horses,
and hounds&mdash;that hunted Indians as if they were
game. The risk was equally great on both sides
and the issue of the battle apparently uncertain.
Columbus attacked the Indians fiercely. The roar of
musketry, the neighing of horses, and bellowing of
the hounds so bewildered the savages that after a
brief and unorganized resistance they took to flight.
Some of them fell by the sword, others were trampled
upon by the horses or torn by the hounds, while
others were taken prisoners. The rest fled to the
forest. Thus was it decided that these innocent
people should bow their necks to the yoke of European
slavery. Columbus lost no time in taking
advantage of his victory. He traversed the whole
region and wherever he went established his authority
without a shadow of resistance. In a few
months the entire populous island was under Spanish
rule.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>Margrite and Buil, the two deadly enemies of
Columbus, meanwhile had reached Spain. He knew
that they would spare no pains to belittle his services
in every way they could and to convince the suspicious
King of Spain that the discoveries made by
him were of very small account. He saw a storm
coming which would certainly overwhelm him if he
did not take measures to avert it. The only means
of doing this was to send the Spanish Court some
conspicuous proof of the wealth which he had
promised would accrue from his discoveries; and to
place himself in a position to furnish such proof, he
found it necessary to make extortionate demands
upon the poor Indians for contributions. He ordered
that the islanders living in the gold region should
bring to him quarterly a certain quantity of gold-dust
and all the others twenty-five pounds of cotton
wool. This was more than the poor people could
furnish. As they had been accustomed from youth
to a life of idleness, it became unendurable for them
to search for gold and gather cotton wool day after
day like slaves. Their sustenance was growing
scarcer each week and yet the Europeans cruelly
drove them to their tasks. As they could not
furnish what was demanded of them, even with their
utmost exertions, they determined to carry out a
plan possible only for those in a desperate condition.
Counting upon the gluttony of the Europeans, they
thought it feasible to compel them to leave the
island if they stopped planting maize and cassava.
They unanimously destroyed their crops and fled
into unapproachable mountain places, where they
subsisted upon fruits and wild turnips, but the
unfortunates were soon the victims of their own
scheme. They quickly felt the pangs of that
hunger which they thought would overcome their
oppressors. Some of them were swept away in a
lamentable manner, others were carried off by contagious
diseases, and the remainder were so exhausted
that they could not bear the burdens imposed upon
them. As far as the Spaniards were concerned they
did not suffer much from this desperate scheme, for
by their own exertions and by the arrival of subsistence
from Europe they were protected from utter
want. The hope of the poor natives, that they
might survive the intruders, perished.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>In the meantime the storm which Columbus saw
rising in the distance at last burst upon him. Margrite
and Buil had so belittled the importance of
his discoveries and pictured his accomplishment in
such odious colors that the Spanish Court lost its
confidence in him. The King decided to send a
representative to the West Indies to investigate
affairs and report. This man, Juan Aguado, was
far from having the ability or insight to discharge
such a duty. Puffed up with his new importance,
Aguado came to Hispaniola and hastened to impress
the Admiral with his dignity. He met Columbus in
a most contemptuous manner and invited all&mdash;Spaniards
as well as natives&mdash;who had any complaints
to make, to appear before him. He eagerly seized
upon every charge which the discontented brought
against Columbus, without inquiring into its truth or
falsity, so that he might collect a mass of individual
complaints which should exhibit the man whom he
hoped to destroy in the worst possible light. Columbus,
as we know, could endure much, but this new
affliction bore heavily upon him. He resolved to
go to Spain at once and make a personal explanation
to the King and Queen, leaving the issue to their
sense of justice. In pursuance of his plan he appointed
his brother Bartolomeo as <i>adelantado</i>, or
governor of the island, during his absence, and a
certain man, named Roldan, to have military command.
This was unfortunate as the latter was an
unprincipled adventurer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>On the tenth of May<a class="fn" id="fr_19" href="#fn_19">[19]</a> Columbus left the island
with two new vessels and two hundred and twenty
men. To make as speedy a voyage as possible he
steered in a direct course for Spain. He did not
know how much this would prolong the voyage. He
had to learn by unfortunate experience what every
seaman now knows, how uncertain the trade-winds
make such a course. It is well known now that
vessels returning from the West Indies, in order to
evade these contrary winds, must steer farther north.
He soon discovered the difficulties of the course
he had selected but, as he was not accustomed
to yield to obstacles, he pushed on all the more
resolutely. His voyage was so greatly protracted,
however, that after three months he had little
prospect of reaching its end. His troubles were
still further increased by the diminution of his
supplies, and at last his crew were reduced to a
very small portion of bread. Hunger at last made
them so furious that they were resolved to slaughter
the Indians on board or, if that were not allowed, to
throw them overboard so that the rest might have
enough to eat. In this crisis Columbus once more
showed that humane feeling which was always
characteristic of him. He firmly refused to permit
it and explained to them that these unfortunate
Indians were their companions, sharers in a common
necessity, and had as much right to food as themselves.
By these and similar representations he
appeased them temporarily. Before they had time
to renew their inhuman demands Heaven itself
interposed and ended all troubles. The coast of
Spain was in sight!</p>

<br /><span class="h2line2">Columbus is Graciously Received by Ferdinand and Isabella&mdash;His Enemies Unable to Shake their Confidence in Him&mdash;The Third Voyage in 1498&mdash;Discovery of the Island of Trinidad at the Mouth of the Orinoco</span></h2>
<p>Serenely conscious of the value of his services,
but with that modesty which is characteristic
of all noble spirits, the calumniated world-discoverer
approached the throne of his sovereign
to establish his innocence of the false accusations
made against him. But it was not necessary for
him to defend himself, for his mere countenance
impressed his royal judges at once with the esteem
in which they had previously held his services, as
well as with shame for their own credulity. As
soon as he had shown them a part only of the valuable
products he had brought with him, all their
suspicions vanished and they strove to compensate
him by every mark of honor. All that Columbus
now proposed was granted, the rights which he already
held in the newly discovered countries were
confirmed, and new ones added. His most urgent
desire was the secure establishment of the colony
he had founded at Hispaniola and to procure as
many men for this purpose as he considered indispensable.
Besides this he wanted a sufficient number
of farm laborers and artisans of every kind so
that he might be able to meet all the requirements of
the colony.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>Unfortunately it was not easy to find many
Spaniards who were ready to sail with the Admiral
to the New World, for many of the emigrants had
returned home and were not as enthusiastic over
the new countries as they might have been. The
gold there could be obtained only by working for
it and these Spaniards did not like to work. Besides
this the climate of Hispaniola was not agreeable to
many of them. They had come back with bleached
and yellow skins and satirically said that they
brought back more gold in their faces than in their
pockets. To procure men for the settlement of
Hispaniola, Columbus advised that the prisons
should be opened and that convicts sentenced to
death or the galleys should be sent to Hispaniola
where they could be useful in the adjacent mines.
An order was at once issued to courts of justice
in Spain that all such criminals should be sent to
the West Indies. In this way Columbus conveyed
to the New World many bad persons who naturally
gave him much trouble.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>Notwithstanding the issue of the royal order
that Columbus should be provided with everything
he asked, the equipment of the fleet progressed very
slowly, for the money promised him could not be
raised at once and those opposed to the undertaking
put many obstacles in his way, which retarded the
progress of the business. At last, however, two
freight vessels left for Hispaniola in January, 1498,
but Columbus had to wait until the thirtieth of
May before he could weigh anchor with six vessels
deficiently manned. He had now determined
to take an entirely new course, hoping to discover
the real Indies. With this purpose in view, after
he reached the Canary Islands he sailed in the same
direction to the island of the Green Cape, which the
Portuguese had discovered. Immediately after leaving
the Canaries he sent half of his vessels directly to
Hispaniola to take fresh provisions to the colony and
ordered their captains to make the voyage as quickly
as possible. After passing the island of the Green
Cape, which is called the Salz Island, he anchored near
a small, barren one where the Portuguese sent their
lepers to be cured. Upon this small island there
are multitudes of turtles which swim there from the
African coast to lay their eggs in the sand. These
animals are very easily caught. When placed upon
their backs they cannot move. It had been found that
to eat their flesh and wash in their blood was a sure
cure for leprosy, so those afflicted with that disease
were sent there to be healed. Besides these turtles
there was an immense number of goats upon this
island, which had sprang from eight goats once
brought there by a Portuguese. There was neither
tree nor stream on the island and the poor lepers
were forced to drink foul rain water which collected
in holes. There were at that time only seven of
them on the island.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>From there Columbus steered to the southward
until he reached the equator, where his fleet was
becalmed. The sun&rsquo;s rays beat down upon their
heads fiercely and they could find no shelter from
its blazing heat. The wine-casks split, all the water
aboard was foul, the provisions rotted, the vessels
themselves grew so hot that the despairing sailors
expected every instant they would take fire. Besides
his own troubles and the despair of his exhausted
companions, he was afflicted by gout, induced by
his anxiety and sleeplessness. He lay racked with
pain, troubled with anxiety over the dangerous
condition of his vessels, tormented with the heat,
without the comfort of a drink of fresh water. At
last the heavens had pity upon him and sent such
an abundant rain that the men could hardly remain
upon deck. It did not greatly abate the terrible
heat, but they secured a supply of fresh water, and,
as the calm disappeared, hope once more arose in
their half-lifeless breasts. They eagerly implored
him not to persist in sailing farther south and this
time he yielded and took a southwesterly course.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>After sailing several days in that direction, upon
the first of August, 1498, the welcome shout of
&ldquo;Land, land!&rdquo; was heard from the mast-head. It was
heavenly music in the ears of the hungry and exhausted
seamen who had been tossing about so
long. The island which they observed was covered
with three hill-tops and so Columbus named it
Trinidad, which name it still bears. It lies not far
from the mouth of the Orinoco River, which empties
into the sea with such force that the fleet was very
unsafe. The waves dashed and broke against them
fiercely and one vessel had the misfortune to be
caught in this mighty wave rush, and for a time was
in great danger of being destroyed. Finding himself
in the midst of a terrible battle of the waves
which tossed his vessels up and down, to the right
and left, as if they had been feathers, he had to
exert all his skill to escape from this dangerous spot
through a channel which had such a cruel aspect
that he named it La Boca del Drago (the Dragon&rsquo;s
Throat).</p>
<p>Columbus was now fully convinced he had reached
the mainland, for no island could contain such a
mighty river as the Orinoco. He steered still farther
to the west along the coast and landed at different
places. He found that the natives of this country
had many of the characteristics of those in Hispaniola,
only they were more intelligent and courageous
and were of whiter skin. They were also decorated
with gold ornaments and costly pearls, which they
willingly exchanged for European trifles. One of
them came to Columbus upon one occasion without
any attendants, while he was on shore seeking fresh
air as a relief from his ailment. He boldly approached
the Admiral&rsquo;s camp, removed his red silk cap, and
placed a gold crown on his head in its place. Columbus
decided the native must be a cacique and took
pains that he should be properly treated.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>These Indians wore a soft woollen cloth wound
about the head, and their bodies from the waist to
the knee were covered with a similar cloth. They
had long but well-kept hair and their weapons were
shields, bows, and arrows. Columbus would gladly
have remained there long enough to ascertain something
of the nature of the inland country but the
wretched condition of his vessels and his continued
indisposition forced him to abandon further investigation
and sail to Hispaniola. Upon this voyage
he discovered the island of Margarita, which has
become so famous for its pearl fisheries.</p>
<p>Worn out with illness and the incessant strain
upon him, he at last reached the colony, to take
a long rest from his cares and troubles.</p>

<br /><span class="h2line2">Wretched Condition of the Colony&mdash;Vasco da Gama Sails around the Cape of Good Hope to the East Indies&mdash;Ojeda&rsquo;s Undertaking&mdash;Cabral Discovers Brazil</span></h2>
<p>The time for rest and recovery had not yet
come for poor Columbus. Unforeseen blows,
new difficulties, new anxieties, new labors
and dangers, so great that they would have tested
the endurance of a well man and exhausted any man
not worn down with trouble, were awaiting him.
His noble brother, Bartolomeo, during his absence
had conducted an expedition to a favorable and not
far distant region and had begun the erection of
a new city, which he named San Domingo in honor
of his father, Domenico. This city, which still
flourishes, has been for a long time one of the most
important in the West Indies and the whole island
has gradually come to take its name. While laying
out the new city, Bartolomeo, with a part of his
men, advanced into parts of the island where
Columbus had never been, leaving behind him the
captain-general Roldan in command of those remaining.
This evil-disposed man betrayed the confidence
reposed in him and proved himself guilty of
blackest ingratitude.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>Roldan had long waited an opportunity to overthrow
the Columbus family and make himself ruler
of the island. The departure of Bartolomeo and
the absence of his great brother seemed to offer just
that opportunity. He improved it to the utmost
of his ability, sought to turn the Spaniards left
behind against Bartolomeo and his younger brother,
Diego, and succeeded so well that most of them
came over to his side. They chose him for their
leader, took up arms against the <i>adelantado</i>, his
plan being to seize all the supplies and take the fort
at San Domingo by storm. This plan, however,
was fortunately thwarted by the vigilance of some of
the officers who had been left to protect the fort, and
the leaders were forced to retreat to another part
of the island. There they strove to win the natives
to their side and so far succeeded that in a short
time the whole island was in the throes of revolution.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>Such was the desperate condition of the spot where
Columbus had planned to rest! Still further to aggravate
his troubles, he learned that the three vessels
sent by him with supplies from the Canaries had not
arrived. It seemed certain to him that they had
been lost by some disaster or another upon the ocean.
For a time everything seemed as good as hopeless for
Columbus. Storms and ocean currents had driven
these vessels out of their prescribed course and, after
being tossed about in unknown regions of the ocean,
they at last reached Hispaniola, but upon that coast
where Roldan and his followers had settled. The
cunning Roldan concealed his seditious undertaking
from the captains of the three vessels and induced
them to send a part of their crews on shore, whom he
agreed to conduct to San Domingo. These men,
the offscourings of the Spanish prisons, gladly
enlisted under his banner, as it would give them a
chance to rob and plunder. This was the first
unpleasant result of the course which Columbus
had inconsiderately taken.</p>
<p>Several days after the Admiral&rsquo;s arrival the three
vessels appeared at San Domingo but without bringing
the men he so much needed. Most of them
had gone and most of the supplies had been consumed.
Roldan, the ingrate, chuckled over Columbus&rsquo;
weakness and boasted of his own authority.
Columbus&rsquo; soul was filled with deep and bitter
indignation. He magnanimously decided, however,
not to pay any attention to the injury done him
but rather to arrange an interview and see if the
thankless Roldan and his erring followers could not
be induced through kindness to return to their
duties. To accomplish this he announced that all
who were sorry for their offences should be forgiven
as soon as they returned to their allegiance. Besides
this he made the same promise to Roldan
and assured him he should be restored to his former
dignity. By this kindly condescension and after
many urgent communications, he carried out his
purpose and had the satisfaction of quelling this
dangerous outbreak without shedding a drop of
blood.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>Thereupon he sent a vessel to Spain to inform the
Court of his discovery of the mainland and of his
suppression of the uprising, with the evidences of
the products which he had found there, consisting of
pearls, gold, and a great quantity of many-colored
cloths, besides finely woven fabrics. He sent his diary,
in which he had kept the course of his vessels
and all the important events which had occurred.
Roldan, on the contrary, as well as his accomplices,
did not fail to send information to the King of a
nature to calumniate the Admiral and to justify his
own shameless conduct. Unfortunately the King
was unjust enough to put more credence in his
statements than in those of the brave Admiral,
notwithstanding the one uttered the truth and the
other shameful calumnies.</p>
<p>In the meantime the King of Portugal, deeply
regretting that he had so mistaken Columbus and
rejected his proposals, resolved to spare no cost in
discovering the long-sought passage to the East
Indies. To retrieve his mistake he fitted out an
expedition and entrusted its command to the skilful
and experienced mariner, Vasco da Gama.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>Difficulties which appeared insurmountable confronted
this undertaking, but fortunately Da Gama
had the same stamp of greatness as Columbus. No
difficulties, however great, could deter him from the
execution of a purpose once formed. It mattered not
to him that the African coasts were unknown, that
they abounded in rocks and sand bars, that the sun
beat down with heat so fierce as to threaten
the burning of the vessels, that storms raged and
menaced them. He met all these obstacles with
an unconquerable spirit, kept resolutely on, and
at last reached the southernmost point of Africa,
the Cape of Good Hope. That was only the starting-point
for such an ambitious spirit as Vasco da
Gama. He pushed farther ahead, sailed around
to the other side of Africa, and at last reached
the city of Melinda, upon the coast of Zanzibar.
He was greatly surprised to find, in place of barbarians
such as he had encountered all along the
African coast, a highly civilized nation resembling
in some respects the Asiatics. They carried on
an extensive trade with foreigners, were Mohammedan
in religion, and were acquainted with many
of the arts of civilization. Eager to accomplish the
real purpose of his expedition, he still sailed on and,
on the twentieth of May, 1498, had the good fortune
to reach the coast of India. He landed at the city
of Calicut, in the Malabar district, on the Indian
Ocean. He was no more surprised at the richness
of the country and the value of its products than at
its orderly administration and the polished manners
of its people. Unfortunately he had nothing on his
vessel which he could exchange for these valuable
products, for the mere trifles which the savages
prized so highly were of little account to these people.
He did not remain there long, therefore, but
turned back to inform the King of the fortunate
outcome of his undertaking.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>Thus, at about the same time Columbus discovered
the New World, another world, though known
already, but of little practical advantage, was
brought into close communication with Europe by
navigation. From this time on wealth poured in
great streams into little Portugal. It was not
without envy that the Spaniards observed the rich
treasure their neighbors were enjoying while they
had not yet been able to pay the expenses of discovering
their new possessions. The enthusiasm
for making discoveries now spread more and more.
Kings and republicans, nobles and burghers sought
to make fortunes, to fit out expeditions, and gain
adventures either for themselves or others. Among
these the chevalier Ojeda, who had accompanied
Columbus on his second voyage, persuaded some
merchants of Seville to equip four vessels and
despatch them on voyages of discovery under his
command. He obtained permission to make these
voyages, and a contract which violated the provisions
of the one which the Court had made with
Columbus. The Bishop of Badajos, who, as Prime
Minister, had charge of all West Indian affairs, was
a sworn enemy of Columbus and took advantage of
his sickness to give Ojeda his diary and charts, to
be used on the voyage. This Ojeda was accompanied
by a well-known Italian nobleman, Amerigo
Vespucci, or, in Latin, Americus Vespucius. With
the help of the diary of Columbus, Ojeda reached
the island of Trinidad, and, after many adventures,
arrived at Hispaniola, where he made common cause
with Roldan, but returned to Spain after he had
been betrayed by him. Ojeda&rsquo;s voyage, though
it was of little importance, brings Americus Vespucius
into notice. In what capacity he accompanied
Ojeda is not clear. He himself maintains
he made the voyage in the service of the Crown.
In his description of it he is not always truthful.
He overestimates his own importance, and yet it
is evident from his writings that he was very fond
of adventure and natural beauty. Americus Vespucius
did not propose that the newly discovered
country should be named for him. He was not so
foolish as that. The name was first given to it
after his death, because it was first made well known
in his writings.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>Realizing the important gains to be made from the
passage discovered by Da Gama, the King of Portugal
fitted out a great fleet which was loaded with European
goods with which to carry on a lucrative
business, and a man named Cabral was appointed
its commander. As he knew how unsafe it was to
sail along the African coast, he steered, as soon as
he was on the other side of the equator, to the west,
and, after keeping in that direction for some time,
suddenly and much to his astonishment found himself
on the coast of a great country. By accident
he had discovered the rich Brazil. He took possession
of it in the name of the King and sent one of
his vessels back with the agreeable news. In this
way was one part of America after another discovered,
demonstrating more and more how correct
were the grounds upon which Columbus&rsquo; conjectures
rested.</p>

<p>Roldan and his followers did everything in
their power to escape responsibility for the
disorder which had occurred and fasten the
blame upon Columbus. At the same time many
malcontents returned to Spain angry because, in
place of the riches they had expected, they had
encountered only hardships and poverty. All of
these people regarded Columbus as the sole cause
of their blasted hopes, and accusations and curses
were heaped upon him all over Spain. Encouraged
by his powerful enemies, they overwhelmed the
King and Queen with petitions for compensation
for their losses and with complaints of the injustice
and oppression they alleged they had suffered from
him. Their ragged attire and pale, famished appearance
aroused sympathy for them and lent their
statements the appearance of truth. Whenever the
King and Queen appeared in public a swarm of these
unfortunates, instigated by the Admiral&rsquo;s enemies,
surrounded them, implored the royal mercy, and inveighed
against Columbus. Is it surprising that a
naturally credulous and suspicious King at last believed
their accusations? Is it surprising also that
the Queen herself, who had hitherto been Columbus&rsquo;
steadfast patron, at last took sides against him?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>Owing to the pressure brought upon them, Ferdinand
and Isabella decided to send a commissioner
to the West Indies with authority to investigate
the Admiral&rsquo;s administration. Francisco de Bobadilla
was the man proposed by the enemies of Columbus,
and he obtained the important position. He had
full authority to remove Columbus and in his heart
was determined to do so. He also received permission,
as soon as he was convinced the charges
were true, not only to remove him but to undertake
the government of the island himself. He further
was conceded authority to take possession of all
the defences, vessels, storehouses, and property of
every kind, to fill all positions, and to send back to
Spain, for appearance before their sovereign, all
persons, without regard to rank, whose dismissal
would in his opinion help to restore order in the
island. Unfortunately Bobadilla was a man completely
unfitted for such a task. He seems to have
been a weak, presumptuous person, puffed up with
insolence by the brief authority which had been so
undeservedly conferred upon him. He regarded
Columbus from that time forward as a convicted
malefactor. At the time this direful messenger
was selected Columbus had succeeded in his efforts
to restore peace and order in all the island districts.
The discontented were satisfied, all Spaniards and
natives had obediently submitted to the laws, the
rich mines were opened, and the development of the
country had begun auspiciously.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>When Bobadilla arrived at San Domingo, Columbus
was still absent in a distant part of the island,
seeing that some of his instructions were carried out.
A sense of justice should have led his judge to
await his return before taking action against him.
But what did such a man as Bobadilla care about
justice? He had not come to hear Columbus&rsquo; explanations
but to condemn him and usurp his place.
As soon as he landed he went directly to the house
of the Admiral and announced that it was his own
from that time forward. Then he took possession
of all his belongings. After doing this he publicly
announced that the King had sent him to depose the
governor, and to settle all grievances which any
person had against him. Not satisfied with this, he
at once released all whom Columbus had arrested
and invited them to make complaints of the injustice
they had suffered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>Having done this, the infamous Bobadilla sent a
messenger to Columbus with the order to appear
immediately before his tribunal and give an account
of his conduct. At the same time he sent him a
royal document showing that he had full authority
for his order. A bolt out of the clear sky could not
have astonished Columbus more than this unexpected
news. He could not trust his own eyes but read the
document over and over again&mdash;a document black
with infamy&mdash;but he could not make it other than it
was. He, the acknowledged discoverer of the New
World, guilty of no offence, was ordered to appear
before the tribunal by a worthless man not fit to
lick the dust from his feet! Columbus was crushed
down under the weight of this outrage. But he
did not hesitate an instant as to his duty. He had
soldiers and his brother Bartolomeo with him and
it would have been easy to answer this unjust judge,
sword in hand. But his noble spirit despised any
method of protecting himself which was not consistent
with the obedience which he considered due to
his superiors, though they were guilty of an atrocious
act of injustice. He hesitated not an instant but
went to San Domingo without a murmur, honorably
to accept the penalty. Having arrived, he waited
upon Bobadilla. &ldquo;Place him in chains,&rdquo; said the
tyrant, without assigning any reason, &ldquo;and take
him away.&rdquo; The inhuman order was executed.
Columbus was fettered and taken to a vessel in
haste. Thus was a man rewarded, for whom, if he
had lived in the days of the old Greeks and Romans,
statues would have been erected, divine honors
awarded, and temples built.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>Thus was Columbus degraded, and in this shameful
manner he was removed from a country which he
had secured for his King at the cost of a thousand
hardships and at great personal danger. He received
this last hard blow of adverse fate with quiet
dignity and with a calmness which declared his
innocence and greatness of spirit more eloquently
than any apology he could have uttered. He was
hurried away; but the cup of his sorrows was not yet
emptied. His patience was to be put to a still
severer test, for Bobadilla had not yet exhausted
the full measure of his cruelty. He realized that
his noble prisoner would only half suffer so long as
he knew that he was the only victim and that his
brothers were still free. He placed them also in
chains and specially ordered that they should have
no communication with each other. Then he
went through the pretence of a trial and sentenced
them to death, but he had not the courage to carry
out his murderous purpose, for he feared he might
not be able to justify himself. He hoped that his
powerful friend, the Bishop of Badajos, Columbus&rsquo;
deadly enemy, would see that the death sentence
was executed. To this end he sent a report of the
proceedings to Spain with the prisoners.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>Hardly was the vessel under way which was taking
Columbus to Spain when the captain, who still
retained his respect for him, approached him to
remove the fetters, but Columbus refused to have
them taken off. &ldquo;Let them remain,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I
am wearing these fetters by the orders of my superiors;
I will continue to wear them until they
remove them; they will find me obedient now as I
always have been.&rdquo; So the fetters remained until
he reached Spain. Bobadilla had ordered that the
prisoners upon arrival should be delivered to the
Bishop of Badajos, so that they should have no
opportunity to secure the sympathy of their patron,
Queen Isabella. But an honorable man, named
Martin, secretly left the vessel and carried a letter
from Columbus to the Queen informing her of what
had happened. The Court was astounded at the
news, for it had never expected that Bobadilla would
so far exceed the authority vested in him. They
recognized the indignity of this treatment and foresaw
that it would shock all Europe. A messenger
was sent at once with the command that Columbus
and his brothers should be released. At the same
time he was requested to appear at Court and money
was sent him so that he might be suitably clothed
and present himself in a manner befitting his rank.
Columbus acceded to the request of the royal pair
and waited upon them. Entering the apartment
in which they were awaiting him, he prostrated himself
before them. He was so overcome with the
monstrous injustice he had suffered that it was a
long time before he could speak. At last he recovered
himself, strengthened by his consciousness of innocence,
and protested against the slanders of his
malicious enemies. He made a long explanation
in which he so completely established his innocence
that Ferdinand and Isabella were entirely convinced
by it. They expressed their regret for what had
occurred and assured him that it had been done without
their knowledge. To confirm this assurance,
they removed Bobadilla from his position and made
reparation to Columbus by marks of affection
and promises of future protection. When a little
later it became necessary to choose a successor to
Bobadilla, it was unmistakably apparent that the
prejudice of the King and Queen against Columbus
was not entirely eradicated, for Nicholas de
Ovando was chosen. He was given a fleet of thirty-two
vessels, a company of two thousand five hundred
persons&mdash;many of them from distinguished
families&mdash;and, besides this, everything that was
necessary for the maintenance and prosperity of the
colony. It was in vain that Columbus appealed for
the rights which had been granted to him at the
beginning of his great undertaking. It was in vain
that he protested against this fresh injustice of
removing him from his position after he had been
pronounced innocent, as if he were a convicted
criminal. His protests met with evasive replies, or
remained unnoticed. He felt the deepest indignation
and could not conceal it. Wherever he went
he took his fetters as an evidence of the black
ingratitude with which his services had been requited.
He kept them hanging in his rooms and ordered that
they should be buried in the grave with him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<h2 id="c15"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Ovando Calls the Audacious Bobadilla to Account&mdash;Columbus Undertakes his Fourth Voyage in 1502</span></h2>
<p>Never had so strong a fleet been sent to the
West Indies as that consigned to Ovando, the
new governor. While he was sailing away
with his thirty-two vessels and two thousand five
hundred men, Columbus had to remain at home with
the mortification of seeing another reap what he
had sown with so many inexpressible hardships.
Soon after Ovando&rsquo;s departure a terrible storm arose
which dispersed his vessels. The news reached
Spain that the fleet was lost. The King, overcome
with distress at this new misfortune which had consigned
so many of his best and bravest subjects to
a watery grave, secluded himself in his palace several
days. Fortunately, however, the report proved
untrue. The fleet outrode the storm. Only one
vessel was lost and the others reached their destination
at the right time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>Ovando arrived at Hispaniola just at the right
time. Had he been delayed longer the new colony
might have been ruined by Bobadilla&rsquo;s foolish and
unjust administration. He had hoped to establish
himself in secure possession by pandering to the
rabble in every unlawful way. To accomplish this
end he revoked all of Columbus&rsquo; wise regulations
and permitted every one to conduct himself in the
most unlicensed manner. His predecessor had
striven to protect the poor Indians from Spanish
outrages, but he left them exposed to violence of
every kind. He divided them among his covetous
followers as slaves and the poor creatures were
assigned to tasks far beyond their strength. The
burden of this labor and the cruel severity which
they had to endure at the hands of their taskmasters
killed many of these naturally weak creatures and
threatened to destroy them all.</p>
<p>The first act of Ovando was the removal of Bobadilla,
who was sent to Spain, together with Roldan,
to give an account of his misconduct. By royal
command he did away with slavery by declaring all
the Indians free. The unlicensed manner of life
followed by the Spaniards was checked by new and
rigid laws. Permission was given for the mining of
gold but upon condition that half the product
should belong to the King or the master of the
island.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>Meanwhile Columbus, bowed down by the weight
of his troubles, appeared from time to time at the
Court, which continued to turn a deaf ear to his complaints.
He did not plead for grace but for justice.
With the royal contract in his hands, he implored the
fulfilment of the promise made to him that he should
be the vice-sovereign of the newly discovered regions.
He was convinced that on his last voyage he had
found the coast of the mainland. His former supposition
that this land was a part of India, if not
entirely removed, was greatly weakened. He now
conjectured that between the mainland and India
there might be a great ocean separating one from
the other. He further thought it possible that in
the region of the Isthmus of Darien there might be
a strait through which a passage could be found
into this ocean and thence to the Indies.</p>
<p>It seemed to him a matter of the highest importance
to ascertain whether there was such a passage.
If so, how much easier and more direct it
would be to sail for the Indies in that direction than
by the passage discovered by the Portuguese around
Africa! Great as was the injury done to him by
the King, his desire to benefit the world by fresh
discoveries was still greater, greater even than his
indignation at being superseded and refused his
rights. He magnanimously resolved to forget all
that had been done to him and in his old age to
risk once more the dangers and hardships of a new
voyage. He announced his purpose to the Court,
which was only too delighted at the opportunity of
ridding itself of his troublesome presence. The sight
of this deserving and greatly maligned man was a
daily reproach to the King and Queen and they were
only too glad to be free from it. Hence they willingly
accepted his offer. They also cherished a
belief that his voyage might have fortunate results
for them. The order to fit out an expedition was
promptly issued.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>What an apology for a fleet! Four wretched little
vessels, the largest of which was not half as large as
an ordinary freight vessel, constituted all the material
entrusted to him for so great an undertaking.
With this little fleet he must navigate a far-distant
unknown ocean and find a way to those East Indies
from which he had promised to bring rich treasures.
What a wretched outfit for the accomplishment of
so vast an undertaking! Any other man would
have abandoned such a seemingly impossible project,
but Columbus thought of his first voyage and had
no hesitation in trusting his life this time to vessels
as weak as those were with which he first crossed
the ocean between Europe and the West Indies.
He went on board courageously, accompanied by
his brother Bartolomeo and his thirteen-year-old
second son, Ferdinand, who afterward wrote the
history of his life.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>On the ninth of May, 1502, ten years after his
first voyage, the gray-haired navigator set sail from
Cadiz and steered for the Canary Islands. The
voyage thus far was very fortunate, except that
one of his vessels, the largest one, was such a slow
sailer that it was very difficult to keep up with the
others. He therefore first directed his course to
Hispaniola that he might exchange this useless
vessel for another. As soon as he reached the
island he sent a messenger to Ovando, acquainting
him with the reasons for his arrival and asking
permission to enter the harbor. The governor, however,
did not believe he had the right to grant this request
as a different course had been laid out for him,
and he had been forbidden to go to Hispaniola. So the
Admiral had to submit to a humiliation which he
must have expected. Notwithstanding his indignation
he called the attention of Ovando to the fact,
of which he was certain from long experience, that
a violent storm was approaching. He begged for
permission therefore to enter the harbor and remain
there until the storm subsided. The governor at
this time was about to send a considerable fleet to
Spain. Columbus&rsquo; proposal, however, was disregarded.
His petition was rejected, his advice spurned,
and his warning was laughed at as the fancy of a
conceited, knavish weather prophet. Meanwhile
the Spanish homeward-bound fleet set sail.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>But the Heavens avenged the slight which had
been put upon Columbus. The storm which he had
foreseen came in all its fury. Columbus saved himself
by keeping close in to shore and his vessels
escaped. Ovando&rsquo;s richly laden fleet, however, on
its way to Spain, became the prey of the storm.
Roldan and Bobadilla paid the penalty of their
treachery to Columbus and perished in the waters.
When the Admiral learned later that they were
among the drowned, he had no doubt that an overruling
Power had thus punished these traitors.
With righteous indignation Columbus left the
island, which he had discovered and which had been
refused him as a shelter from a terrible storm, and
sailed westward for the mainland. He was beset
by many dangers on this voyage but finally had
the good fortune to reach an island called Guanaja,
lying not far from the main coast of Honduras.
As soon as he had come to anchor he sent his brother
Bartolomeo with some armed men ashore to make
investigations. As Bartolomeo approached the beach
he met a large Indian boat much more skilfully
built than any he had ever seen before in that region.
It was of considerable length, eight feet wide, and
covered in the middle with a roof of palm leaves
which gave it the appearance of a large gondola.
The wives and children of the Indians were on
board, besides twenty-five men. As soon as they
were overtaken they gave themselves up as prisoners,
without resistance, although they were armed.
Their cargo was examined and found to consist of
woollen stuffs, some pieces of clothing, and great
bands of cloth which served as draperies for the
women, large wooden swords sharpened on both
sides, besides copper hatchets and some other
articles made of metal. Their food was of the same
kind as that in Hispaniola except that they had a
drink made of maize, resembling beer, and a small
stock of cocoa beans of which they were very fond
and which also served for money. These were the
first beans of the kind ever seen by Europeans.
Another remarkable thing about these savages was
the modest manner in which they attired themselves.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>The Admiral was delighted to have these natives
in his power, as he hoped to learn from them much
that he wished to know. He treated them generously,
exchanged European articles for their own, and gave
them to understand they could go back with their
boat whenever it pleased them. One old man, who
seemed to be the most distinguished among them,
remained on board a long time and much useful
knowledge was gained from him which was of
service in further communications with the natives.</p>
<p>Columbus learned from this old man that there
was a great region farther to the west which produced
gold in abundance. The people in that
region wore golden circlets on their heads and
heavy gold rings on their fingers, arms, and ankles.
They had tables, chairs, and chests of gold; and
corals, spices, and other valuable articles could be
found there in great quantities. This region was
no other than the rich Mexico. But great as was
the Admiral&rsquo;s desire to secure these treasures, his
desire to effect the purpose of his voyage by discovering
the straits, which he hoped to find not far
away, was still greater. After much consideration
he abandoned the idea of obtaining these treasures
which he was assured were so near. Without paying
heed to the complaints of his companions he directed
his course along the shore of the mainland toward
the east.</p>

<h2 id="c16"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XVI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Columbus Vainly Attempts to Find the Passage between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans</span></h2>
<p>In pursuance of his plan Columbus sailed from
the coast of Honduras to the eastward, hoping
to find the straits which the natives assured
him were in that direction. On their eastern journey
along the coast they saw men who were very different
from those they had met before and at the same
time more uncivilized. They went entirely naked,
ate raw meat and fish, and their ears were distended
even to their shoulders by the many things they
wore in them. They were tattooed with pictures
of deer, lions, and other animals all over their bodies.
The most important of the natives were distinguished
from the others by white and red head coverings of
woollen stuff. Some were black, others red, and still
others painted their lips, nostrils, and eyes with
stripes of various colors.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>From there he sailed farther on, making, however,
but a short distance each day as the wind was almost
continually contrary and he was greatly troubled
by the currents. At last he reached a cape, stretching
toward the south, and there the wind was so
favorable that he coasted along without difficulty.
Columbus, who never was lacking in gratitude toward
the only Source of all good, named this cape
Gracias &aacute; Dios, or &ldquo;Thanks to God.&rdquo; In one place
where they lay at anchor for several days they
encountered boats filled with armed savages who
looked as if they intended to prevent them from making
a landing. As soon as they were convinced,
however, of the friendly intentions of the Spaniards,
they approached with the utmost confidence and
offered to sell their weapons of various kinds, crossbows,
canes of a black hardwood&mdash;tipped with fish
bone,&mdash;clubs, waistcoats of wool, and little pieces of
pale gold which they wore on their necks. The
Admiral presented them with various European
playthings without taking anything for them. This
seemed to dissatisfy them and when the Spaniards
also declined their repeated invitation to go ashore
they regarded it as a sign of mistrust. For this
reason they shortly sent an old man of distinguished
appearance, accompanied by two young maidens
wearing gold necklaces, as ambassadors to the
Spaniards. The old man appeared with a banner
in his hand, which doubtless was a flag of truce, and
desired to be conducted to the Admiral. Columbus
received them courteously, provided them with
food and clothing, and sent them back to shore
delighted with their friendly treatment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>On the next day Columbus&rsquo; brother went ashore
and saw all the presents which had been given to
the natives lying in a heap, probably because it
was not their custom to accept gifts without making
gifts in return. As he landed, two of the foremost
natives took him by the arms and requested him to
sit between them on the grass. He did as they
wished, asked them various questions with the
help of an interpreter, and ordered his secretary to
take down their answers in writing. Hardly had
the savages noticed pen, paper, and ink before they
sprang up excitedly and ran up to their fellows who
were looking on near by. The poor superstitious
people fancied that the secretary was a magician,
that the writing materials were the instruments
of his magic, and that he would do them harm.
Every effort was made to convince them of their
folly but they would not venture to come near the
Spaniards until they had averted the danger in their
peculiar way, which was as follows: They threw
a kind of powder at them which gave out a smoke,
and this smoke, which they probably believed had
the power of averting magic, they managed so that
it should touch the one whom they regarded as the
master magician. Immediately after this Bartolomeo
went with them to their village. The most
remarkable thing he saw was a large wooden structure
which served as a burial-place. He found several
corpses in it wrapped in woollen cloths, one
of which was embalmed. Upon each one of the
graves there was a board upon which were figures of
animals. Upon some there were likenesses of the
deceased, ornamented in various ways. On the next
day the Admiral detained several natives on board
in order to obtain further information from them,
which led the others to believe that he intended to
keep them until they were ransomed. Accordingly
they sent messengers to him with two young wild
hogs as a ransom for the prisoners. The Admiral
sought to make them understand their comrades
were not prisoners and that a ransom was not necessary.
He bought the hogs from them, whereupon
they returned contented.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>After another cruise of several days the Admiral
reached the mouth of a stream, came to anchor,
and sent a boat&rsquo;s crew ashore, but a multitude of
armed natives resisted their landing. Over a hundred
sprang waist deep into the water, threateningly
brandished their lances, blew horns, beat a kind
of drum, dashed water at the Spaniards, and spit
at them as a sign of their contempt and aversion.
The Spaniards had orders to maintain a friendly
attitude toward them. They made no reply to the
hostile actions of the natives but contented themselves
with watching the spectacle at a safe distance
until the leaders were weary of their useless operations,
when, in place of a battle, communication was
opened up with them, and an exchange of several
little trifles was made for sixteen plates of gold,
valued at one hundred and fifty ducats.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>On the next day the natives changed their views
of the peaceful attitude of the Spaniards toward
them. They attributed it to cowardice and even
went so far with their audacity as to hurl their
spears at the approaching boats. Finding it necessary
to give them a lesson they could understand,
a cannon was fired and at the same time one of the
savages was wounded by an arrow, which created a
panic among them. The Spaniards availed themselves
of the opportunity to land without inflicting
further injury upon the fugitives. They made
signals to them in the hope of inducing them to
return. As the natives were now convinced that the
white strangers would not harm them, they came
back, laid down their arms, and exchanged their
gold quietly and peacefully.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>After learning the nature of the region and its
products the Admiral continued his course along the
coast, still hoping to find the straits. On this
voyage he at last came to a gulf with a spacious
and secure harbor. The natives there had built
an apparently large town, which was densely populated
and surrounded by well-cultivated land.
Columbus named this place Porto Bello on account
of its beautiful harbor. The natives were universally
friendly and brought fine-spun cloths, besides
all kinds of food, which they gladly exchanged
for nails, needles, and bells, and other similar trifles.
From there Columbus sailed eight miles farther to
that region where now is the city of Nombre de Dios.
As the stormy weather compelled him to remain
there several days he spent the time in repairing
his vessels, which had now become badly damaged.
After this he resumed his voyage but bad weather
forced him to run into a little harbor which he named
the &ldquo;Refuge.&rdquo; The natives there were also very
friendly at first but the insulting behavior of a
sailor provoked them to hostility. Confiding in
their numbers, they made a concerted attack and
attempted to board the vessels. The Admiral tried
to induce them to abandon their purpose but, as his
good offices were of no avail, he had a cannon fired
in hopes that its mere noise would intimidate them.
He was mistaken, however. When the natives
saw that no damage was done, they became even
bolder and replied to the cannon with shouts of derision.
Seeing that it was necessary to make some
impression upon them and show them what the
cannon could do, he had a large one heavily loaded
and aimed at a hill where a multitude of the natives
were collected. The ball flew through the crowd.
They saw to their dismay that the thunder could
also hit and they fled in consternation into the woods.
These natives were the handsomest he had yet seen.
They were slim, had well-shaped limbs, and none of
them the protruding paunches which were common
among the savages. The harbor was filled with
large alligators which used to come down to the
shore to sleep. These animals gave out an aroma
which filled the air. Although they seemed to be
timid, they would strive, when attacked, to seize and
devour their assailant.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>At last Columbus began to despair of finding the
passage between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.
As he was also threatened by furious storm winds he
decided to turn back, and sailed to a spot which
he called Veragua and in which, according to the
natives, there were rich gold mines. A terrible
storm, which lasted several days, and the rapid
diminishing of his supplies made this short voyage
one of his most troublesome and dangerous. The
entire supply of food which remained, after being
at sea eight months, consisted of some poor remnants
of ship biscuit which had become so tainted by the
hot, damp weather of the region that it was unfit
to eat. Notwithstanding this, the disgusting stuff
was eagerly devoured, but those eating it would go
off into dark corners so as not to see what they were
putting into their mouths. In this wretched plight
they looked askance at the great number of sharks
swimming around the vessels. The superstitious
followers of Columbus regarded these monsters as
signs of misfortune. But in spite of their superstitious
fears and in spite of the disgust which Europeans
have for such oily flesh, these famished people devoured
shark meat with still greater zest because it
tasted better than maggoty biscuit.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<h2 id="c17"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XVII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Columbus Abandons the Hope of Discovering a Passage to the Pacific and Returns to Jamaica, where his Vessels are Exposed to Great Danger&mdash;Two Boats are Sent to Haiti for Help</span></h2>
<p>Before Columbus could reach the gold region
of Veragua he was forced by a gale to come
to anchor for a shorter or longer time at
different places to weather the storms. At one of
these places he beheld a curious sight. The natives
did not live on the ground like other people but in
houses in the air, built among the branches of trees.
In reality it seemed as if they lived like the birds.
They chose this mode of living to protect themselves
from floods, wild animals, and their enemies. They
reached their habitations by ladders and, once they
were at home, drew them up, so that all access to
them was cut off.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>At last they reached Veragua, with expectations
of rich booty, and came to anchor at the mouth of
a river which Columbus named Belen. They shortly
became acquainted with some of the natives and,
learning from them that at the distance of a few
days&rsquo; journey up the stream there was the city of a
prince named Quibia, Columbus determined to sail
up the river. Having done so, he sent his brother,
Bartolomeo, ashore to give this Indian prince a fitting
welcome. He had already been informed of
the arrival of the whites, came to meet Bartolomeo,
and they greeted one another with becoming friendliness.
On the next day the prince visited the Admiral,
who received him in a manner befitting his rank,
and speedily made him his friend by a gift of some
European trifles.</p>
<p>Bartolomeo in the meantime had made careful
inquiries about the gold mines and, learning their
whereabouts, went to them. When the Spaniards
reached the spot they found some pure gold lying at
the roots of a tree, which was considered a sure sign
that there must be an abundance of the metal in
the soil. After picking up the pieces lying about
they returned, bringing the news of their fortunate
discovery to the Admiral, who at once decided to
establish a colony there and ordered the erection of
houses at the mouth of the river Belen. Work was
begun enthusiastically and in a short time wooden
houses, covered with palm leaves, were built. Columbus
selected eighty men for colonists and made
his brother Bartolomeo their leader. They were
provided with all the tools and materials necessary
to make life comfortable and safe. He also left
much fishing tackle with them as the waters in that
region abounded in excellent fish. Among others
there was a kind of anchovy, which the natives
caught in a curious way. These fish when they were
pursued by others would leap out of the water upon
the dry land. The Indians would cover their
canoes with a great quantity of palm leaves and
row about the river splashing their oars, and the
fish, mistaking the foliage on the canoes for land,
would spring into them, where they were captured.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>When all his arrangements had been completed
and the Admiral was ready to make his return
voyage to Spain, he learned to his great surprise
that Prince Quibia, jealous at the settlement of
Europeans in his country, had planned to fire the
houses of the colonists. He counselled with his
brother how to prevent this calamity, and both
decided that it was absolutely necessary to get the
start of him by seizing the Prince in person. Bartolomeo
undertook to carry out their plan. Accompanied
by a strong force, he marched directly to the
city of Veragua, where the Prince&rsquo;s dwelling stood
upon a solitary eminence. When they had reached it
Quibia requested Bartolomeo not to come to his house
as he would come out to meet them. Bartolomeo
took only five men with him and ordered the rest
to follow at a little distance and, as soon as he gave
the signal with a musket shot, to rush forward and
seize the house and allow no one to escape. The
Prince came forward but at the very instant he was
about to receive his guest he found himself a prisoner.
Thereupon the signal was given, the Spaniards
surrounded the house, and all who were in it were
taken prisoners without resistance. This deed was
accomplished quickly, but a new succession of
reverses began for Columbus, which lasted to the
end of his life.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>The Prince was taken to the vessel, bound hand
and foot. It was night when the boat was pushed
off. The prisoner, who was fastened to it by ropes,
complained of severe pain in his hands because
they were tied too tightly. His humane captors
loosened the rope but kept hold of it. Waiting his
opportunity the Prince suddenly jumped overboard.
They attempted in vain to drag him out again.
His dexterity in swimming and the darkness of the
night enabled him to escape. Quibia at once laid
his plans to take a terrible revenge. He attacked
the colony before it was aware by stealing through
the dense forests with his men. They rushed on
with wild cries and poured a shower of burning
arrows upon the palm leaf roofs of the new houses,
hoping to pierce and burn them. The distance,
however, was too great. Thereupon ensued a desperate
struggle which would have resulted in the
destruction of the colony if it had not been saved
by the courage of Bartolomeo, who charged into
the very midst of the enemy with a few men so
furiously that at last they gave way after some had
been killed and some wounded. Among the latter
was Bartolomeo himself, who was wounded in the
breast by an arrow, but not fatally. They hoped
that the Prince would be deterred by this victory
from further acts of hostility but they were disappointed.
He sought revenge more furiously than
ever and undoubtedly the colony would have been
the victim of his wrath had not the colonists, who
clearly saw the danger enveloping them, decided
to trust themselves to the mercy of the waves on
the worm-eaten, crazy vessels rather than expose
themselves daily to the fury of the savages. The
Admiral, when informed of their decision, realized
that it was necessary, and took them on board his
vessels in canoes lashed together.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>There was no resort left for the Admiral except
to reach Hispaniola with his crazy vessels, for it
was impossible to go to Spain with them, but the
elements seemed to be in a conspiracy to thwart his
purpose. A fearful hurricane and thunder storm
swept the ocean to its very depths and hurled the
vessels about so violently that the crews lost all
courage. Vainly Columbus sought to apply all
those precautionary measures which experience had
taught him. They did not listen to his commands
and even if they had listened they were too terrified,
confused, and exhausted to execute them. One of
his vessels was lost as it approached the coast of
the mainland and the others leaked so badly that
the united exertions of all on board barely availed
to keep them from sinking. In these desperate
conditions Columbus steered for Cuba, hoping that
he might be able to make the necessary repairs
there. But this hope was denied him. A new and
terrible storm drove him from the coast with irresistible
fury out to sea and dashed the two vessels
together so violently that all thought their last
moment had come. But Providence preserved
Columbus&rsquo; life. His virtue was yet to be tried by
harder tests. The joints of his vessels withstood
the strain and, in the meantime having reached the
coast of Jamaica, he ran them ashore to prevent
them from sinking. Then he rescued himself and
his companions by stranding them. Repairing them
was no longer to be thought of for they were utterly
worthless. It was fortunate from the Admiral&rsquo;s
point of view that they were not destroyed, as he
had two reasons for preferring that he and his companions
should live upon the wrecks rather than
ashore. In the first place they would be more secure
from attack by the natives than on land, and in
the second place he could prevent them from acts of
hostility caused by the outrages of his own people.
He propped up the stranded vessels as securely as
he could, roofed over the decks, and forbade his men
to go ashore.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>The natives soon discovered the vessels and in
pursuance of the orders of Columbus were greeted
in a friendly manner. The result was that they
also displayed a friendly spirit and brought a profusion
of articles of food to exchange for the trifles
which the Spaniards always carried. They willingly
exchanged two geese for a bit of tinsel, a loaf of their
bread for a glass bead, and for bells the most valuable
things they had for barter. Columbus in the
meantime counselled with his friends as to the best
way of leaving the island. Only one course seemed
feasible and that was to request the governor of
Hispaniola to send a vessel to take them off. Then
the question arose how to get in communication
with him. They had not a single boat left and
Hispaniola was thirty miles distant from Jamaica.
At last a way was found. By his humane and
friendly attitude toward the natives Columbus
so ingratiated himself that they were willing to
sell him one or more of their canoes. They were
wretched affairs, hardly deserving the name of
boat, for they were hollowed out of tree trunks and
were shapeless, poorly made things which they could
hardly row ashore. The least gust of wind would
upset them and the smallest waves wash over them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>But notwithstanding the danger to life which
seemed inevitable in undertaking a long sea journey
in one of these wretched affairs, two daring men
were found in Columbus&rsquo; crew willing to risk their
lives in an effort to rescue the Admiral and his men.
One was named Mendez, the other Fiesko; the one
a Spaniard, the other a Genoese. Each had a canoe
of his own, and was accompanied by six Spaniards
and some natives who were to do the rowing. It
was arranged that as soon as they were fortunate
enough to reach Hispaniola, Fiesko should return
and inform the Admiral, while Mendez should go
to San Domingo and execute the duty assigned him
by Columbus. The daring navigators sailed away
accompanied by the blessings and good wishes of
their companions left behind. After they had been
rowing continuously for two days and nights, exposed
to intolerable heat, they began to fear that they had
lost their way and were going by Hispaniola out into
the open ocean. Their distress was great for their
stock of water was exhausted and they were suffering
horribly from heat, thirst, and exhaustion. Some
of the natives dropped dead at their oars and all
the others dreaded a similar fate. The only restorative
they had was sea-water held in the mouth to
cool the tongue.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>At last their dreadful condition was relieved by a
ray of hope. It was night and, as the moon rose
above the horizon, they observed at the place of
its rising an elevation which they recognized as a
cliff. This raised their hopes that they were near
an island and encouraged them to attempt rowing
to it with all their strength. When they reached it
they found only a barren rock upon which apparently
there was neither food nor drink. But they jumped
out of the canoes and wandered despairingly about
the rocky islet. In the clefts of the rocks they
found an abundant store of rain-water which was
as pure and clear as the water of a cistern. Unfortunately
in their joy at finding this treasure they
forgot the wise rule of moderation. They drank,
and drank too much. Some of them paid the
penalty with their lives, others with impaired health.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>The most pressing necessity of our adventurers
having been removed, a still more serious question
presented itself. What was to be done next?
Fortunately they found upon the shore of the island
some fish washed up by the sea, and as these sufficed
for their immediate wants, both the leaders decided
to remain in the desolate place during the heat of
the day and start away again toward evening in
their search for land. As soon as evening came the
unfortunates resumed their course, rowing all night
by moonlight. At daybreak&mdash;to their unspeakable
joy&mdash;they reached the west coast of Hispaniola.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<h2 id="c18"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XVIII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Conspiracy against Columbus at Jamaica&mdash;He Returns to Spain and Vainly Seeks Reinstatement&mdash;He Dies at Valladolid in 1506</span></h2>
<p>Day after day the companions of Columbus
watched the region whence Fiesko was to
come with the news that Mendez had made
a landing at Hispaniola, but they watched in vain.
Fiesko did not appear. Thereupon they became
desperate. They were sure both the adventurers
had been lost and all hope of release from the island
vanished. The air was filled with their complaints
and these complaints at last changed to open revolt.
They shrieked, cursed, and threatened the life of
Columbus, and the dark hour seemed to have come
when the great leader, who had overcome so many
dangers, should fall a victim to their blind rage.
Columbus was confined to his bed with a painful
ailment, a large part of his crew were in a similar
plight. Those who were on their feet had submitted
themselves to the leadership of two brothers, named
Porras. The oldest of these, an unfeeling wretch,
approached the Admiral&rsquo;s bed and savagely demanded
to know why he did not go back to Spain.
Columbus replied with his customary composure
that he had no way of returning, much as he wished
to do so; if any one of his men could show him the
way to do it, he would gladly go. Gracious as his
answer was, it made not the slightest impression
upon the shameless Porras. He replied even more
ferociously that it was no time for pretences. For
his part he was going to sail. Thereupon he shouted
to the assembled crowd: &ldquo;Those who wish to follow
me, step forward.&rdquo; His words were the sign for a
universal uprising on the vessel. Most of them at
once declared that they were ready to follow him.
The Admiral, suffering as he was with the torments
of gout, sprang from his bed to calm the disturbance,
but his attendants who were justly afraid he would
be murdered, restrained him. The mutineers gave
way and retired when his brother, Bartolomeo,
rushed into their midst, pike in hand, to punish
them for their treachery. The leaders of the revolt
in the meantime seized ten small craft which the
Admiral had secured from the natives and sprang
into them. This caused the others who had taken
no part in the uprising to waver in their loyalty and
most of them got into the boats and asked to be
taken with them. It was with the deepest concern
that Columbus, his brother, Bartolomeo, and his
son Ferdinand watched this distressing spectacle.
The poor bedridden invalid saw himself deserted
by almost all his crew. The few faithful attendants
gathered around his bed and engaged in excited
discussion, while he thanked them for their proof
of loyalty and encouraged them to remain steadfast
in their duties and to look for a speedy termination
of their present wretched condition, assuring them
that in the future their honesty and loyalty would
be rewarded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>The unfeeling mutineers in the meantime rowed
with exultant shouts to the eastern point of the
island, thence passing over to Hispaniola. When
they went ashore they plundered and outraged the
natives and shamelessly advised them to hold the
Admiral responsible, as he was the sole cause of
their trouble. If they could get no indemnity from
him, they had their permission to kill him. It was
his intention to make them all suffer and if they
were smart they would get ahead of him. This
greatly embittered the Indians against their treacherous
leaders. Next they forced a large number of
Indians, whom they had made prisoners, to go on
board and do the rowing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>They had hardly gone four miles after this when
a furious wind arose and made the sea so rough
that their small craft began to fill with water. In
order to lighten them, the wretches determined to
murder the Indians and throw them overboard.
Some of them had already been killed when the
others, growing desperate, flung themselves into
the water and imploring mercy swam along near
the canoes. But with unheard-of cruelty, whenever
they became exhausted and to rest themselves
would cling for a little while to the canoes, these
European monsters would push them off and inhumanly
leave them to die. No less than eighteen
were thus sacrificed, and the same dreadful fate
would have overtaken all of them had not the
Spaniards doubted the possibility of reaching Jamaica
without the help of the few remaining.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<p>Columbus in the meantime bore his great trouble
with his customary resolution and, sick as he was,
looked after the other invalids with the tenderness
of a father. Heaven blessed his generous solicitude
and sympathy and in a short time the old man had
the pleasure of seeing all of them restored to health.
But now he had to contend with a new danger.
The Indians, who had supplied him with provisions
up to that time, began to fear that these voracious
Europeans would stay there forever and consume
everything they could produce. This fear and the
outrages from which they had suffered at the hands
of the mutineers prejudiced them against the whites,
and the result was they stopped bringing supplies
to the vessels. Columbus, however, found a way of
surmounting this difficulty, for which he was indebted
to his knowledge of astronomy. He foresaw that
an eclipse of the moon was at hand and he made use
of this knowledge to arouse anew the respect and
hospitality of the natives. With the help of one
of the natives of Hispaniola he summoned the
headmen by the announcement that he had something
of great importance to communicate to them.
When they appeared, he told them through an Indian
interpreter that he and his companions were people
who knew the God that made the heavens and the
earth. This God, who protected the good and
punished the bad, would also punish them if they
refused any longer to supply food. As a sign of the
punishment hanging over them, the moon the next
night would wear a red and wrathful face, showing
them what trouble they would bring upon themselves
if they longer refused to be hospitable to their guests.
At first they laughed at the prophecy, but when the
moon began to grow dark and the darkness increased,
there was universal consternation among them. With
shrieks and howls they implored the Admiral to pray
to his God that He would not punish them, sacredly
promising to supply him with everything necessary
to life. Columbus agreed to do as they wished and
shut himself up in his cabin for the moment, knowing
that the darkness would soon disappear. Then
he reappeared and adjured the natives not to be
troubled. God, he said, saw with great pleasure
that their sentiments had changed. He therefore
would not punish them and, as a sign of His graciousness,
the moon would lose its angry appearance and
soon shine upon them with its friendly beams.
When this prophecy had been fulfilled they praised
the Christian God in their joyous surprise and generously
provided the wonderful man, who had foretold
all this, with everything he needed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<p>Eight long dreary months had passed since
Mendez and Fiesko had left for Hispaniola and
nothing had been heard of them. There was not
the least doubt they had perished and the companions
of Columbus gave up all hope of the expected
assistance. In despair they contemplated deserting
their leader and joining the mutineers who were
roaming about the island and living upon their
plunder. Just as they were about carrying out
their purpose, to their great surprise a European
vessel was seen lying at anchor not far from shore.
It did not remain there long before its captain came
to the Admiral in a boat and gave him a letter from
the governor, together with a cask of wine and two
sides of bacon. Hardly had he done this when he
sprang back into his boat, rowed to his vessel, and
sailed away. The letter which he brought contained
nothing more than some empty words.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<p>Ovando, the governor of Hispaniola, was anxious
that Columbus should miserably perish, for he feared
that the discoverer, if he returned to Spain, might
establish his rights and cause him to lose his position.
He wished to know, therefore, just how great the
necessities of this man were, whom he desired out
of his way, and whether he could accomplish his
infamous purpose if he delayed sending a vessel to
him for a long time. This was the malicious reason,
as some of the historians maintain, for sending his
representative with orders to observe the condition
of Columbus&rsquo; affairs and then sail away again.
Others give a more inoffensive reason. Ovando,
they say, feared that Columbus was using the
stranding of his vessels as a pretext for coming to
Hispaniola with a good grace and then securing the
sovereignty by force. It was on this account that
he had sent a spy to ascertain whether the affairs
of the Admiral were such as had been described.
Columbus informed his men that the vessel had
sailed away because it was too small to take them
and their belongings, that Mendez and Fiesko had
fortunately arrived at Hispaniola and had orders
to buy a larger vessel upon his account, which would
soon come to their relief. In reality he had received
no news of the fate of either of them.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the fact that the brave Fiesko had
been prostrated with a fever contracted on the rocky
island, true to his promise, he was anxious to return
to the Admiral and bring him news of the fortunate
outcome of their voyage. But not one of his companions
could be induced to make that perilous voyage
again. Neither promises nor threats were of
any avail and he found himself forced to go to San
Domingo against his will. There he and Mendez
repeatedly implored the governor to let them buy a
vessel for the relief of their leader, but the governor
managed in various ways to protract the business
so that he might carry out his own designs. Meanwhile
Columbus had made many fruitless attempts
to bring the rebels back to their allegiance. They
not only persisted in their disloyalty but they demanded
that the Admiral should give them half
of all the clothing and other articles on the stranded
vessels. If he refused to do this they threatened to
take them by force. When the refusal was actually
made they prepared to execute their threat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>As Columbus was still sick he sent his brother
Bartolomeo with an armed force to meet them. He
had orders to use his good offices and not to begin
hostilities until all other means were exhausted.
Bartolomeo carried out the order, but when he
approached in a friendly way and invited them to
make peace they took it as a confession of weakness
and the battle began. Six of them had planned to
attack Bartolomeo and not to give up until they
saw him fall. But Bartolomeo met them fearlessly
and, as he was faithfully supported by his little
following, he charged upon the rebels with such
resistless force that in a short time he won a complete
victory. Several were put to the sword, others
were taken prisoners, and the rest escaped by flight.
Among the prisoners who were taken back to the
vessels in chains was Porras, the leader of the
rebels, whom Bartolomeo had caught and disarmed
with his own hands. He himself received
a wound in the hand. Shortly after this the fugitives
sent to the Admiral messages imploring his mercy,
and the magnanimous man, who was always more
inclined to forgiveness than revenge, at once granted
their prayer. At last order was restored. Every
one returned to duty, every one was forgiven, and
only the audacious leader of the mutiny remained
in chains as a fitting punishment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p>Mendez and Fiesko meanwhile had unceasingly
striven to induce the governor of Hispaniola to
allow them the privilege of buying a vessel with
which to fetch away Columbus and his people from
Jamaica. He hesitated long before granting this reasonable
request but, at last, fearing they might apply
to the Spanish Court if he persisted in leaving the
Admiral helpless, he consented. Thus was Columbus
relieved and at a time when everything looked
hopeless. After spending a whole year in the struggle
with poverty and calamity, the vessel arrived.
All embarked joyfully June 28, 1504, and sailed to
San Domingo which they reached August 13. The
governor, concealing his real sentiments under the
cloak of pretension and flattery, ordered Columbus
to be received with all honor. At the same time,
however, when this coward, because of his fears,
was pretending to honor Columbus, he was secretly
venting his spite against him in various malicious
ways. He particularly arranged that the leader
of the mutineers, who was to be taken to Spain in
chains, should bring a suit for his immediate release,
and at the same time threatened to bring proceedings
against those who remained faithful to Columbus.
The Admiral, who had borne many an injury at the
hands of this unscrupulous man with patience, felt
strong enough to endure this last outrage also.
But he made all possible haste to leave a country
whose discovery had been his misfortune, and as
soon as a second vessel had been fitted out he sailed
for Spain, September 12, 1504. The same adverse
fate which had followed him so persistently on his
previous voyage overtook him on this last one.
A furious storm was so disastrous to one of his
vessels that he had to send it back to Hispaniola.
The other was so badly damaged that it was doubtful
whether it could accomplish the journey. Besides
other mishaps it lost its fore and mainmasts. Columbus
nevertheless kept on his course undauntedly.
With his half-wrecked vessel he traversed seven
hundred miles of the ocean and finally reached,
though with extreme difficulty, the harbor of St.
Lucas, in Andalusia, early in November in the year
1504. He had spent only a few days in Spain,
recovering from the fatigue of his journey, when the
news of a mournful event reached him. His patroness
and only protector, Isabella, died November
26, 1504. He had looked to her as his last and
only reliance in obtaining his rights. Now she was
gone! What could he expect from the prejudiced
King, who had always shown himself inimical to
him?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<p>Nevertheless, as soon as his health was in some
measure restored, he hastened to the Court to make
a report of all that had occurred. But he was
coolly received. His just complaints of the many
injuries he had suffered from his enemies were not
listened to, and his reasonable request that his
rights should be restored to him was evaded by
shallow pretexts. Thus was this great and well-deserving
man condemned to devote the evening
of his life to the business of vainly trying to obtain
justice from an unjust judge and mercy from a
merciless King. Heaven at last put an end to his
long and bitter suffering. Exhausted by the trials
and hardships he had undergone, he died at Valladolid
on Ascension Day, May 20, 1506, his last
words being, &ldquo;Into Thy hands, O Lord, I commit
my spirit.&rdquo; His death was worthy of his life. He
died with a peaceful spirit and with that trust in God
which had characterized him during his whole life,
even when it was darkest. His joyful soul hastened
to that judgment-seat before which even Kings must
appear. His earthly remains were at first deposited
in the monastery of St. Francis in Valladolid and
six years later were taken to the Carthusian monastery
at Seville, where King Ferdinand erected
a costly memorial to the discoverer. From this
place the body was removed in 1536 to the island of
San Domingo, the scene of his principal discoveries,
and upon the cession of that island to the French
it was taken to Cuba where the ashes rest in the
cathedral of its capital. Near the high altar of
this splendid structure his bust stands in a niche, and
close by it is a silver urn which contains all that is
left of the renowned explorer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<p>In person Columbus was tall and shapely. His
appearance was distinguished. He had a long face,
aquiline nose, soft blue eyes, and a very fair complexion.
In his youth his hair was auburn but,
owing to his many hardships and severe labors, it
grew white early, for his life was a continual alternation
from fortune to misfortune, from calumny
to laudation, from the highest expressions of honor
to the lowest degradations. Few and fleeting were
his hours of pleasure, for hardly a day passed that
he was not called upon to contend with physical
pain or troublesome mishaps or aggravating injuries.
Otherwise he was strong in his bodily constitution
and was very powerful and agile. He had a pleasing
and attractive manner and was friendly and
modest with every one. He was courteous to strangers,
affable to his attendants, merry with his good
friends and, what was especially characteristic of
him, in almost every situation of life he conducted
himself in a manner that commanded admiration.
He lived moderately, dressed modestly, and whenever
in his various expeditions he was overtaken by
adverse circumstances, he allowed himself no comforts
which were not shared by his companions. In
his youth he devoted himself industriously to the
sciences, in which he excelled the average scholars of
his time. But what is most worthy of commendation
was the quiet, sincere piety which he manifested
upon every occasion. He was inclined to anger, but
he so far overcame this passion with the principles
of his religion that he could display an admirable
gentleness and patience when exposed to the coarse
assaults of his unworthy adversaries.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<p>Such was the man who was so grossly mistaken
and misjudged by his contemporaries but whose
name is immortal and must ever arouse love and
admiration in the hearts of all who prize the nobility
of virtue and human greatness.</p>

<br /><span class="h2line2">Diego, Columbus&rsquo; Son, Secures the Rights coming to him from his Father&mdash;The Spaniards Extend their Authority in Central America and Rule Cruelly&mdash;Ponce de Leon&rsquo;s Discovery of Florida</span></h2>
<p>Diego, Columbus&rsquo; eldest son, after the death
of his great father, urged the demand for
the fulfilment of the contract made by the
King, by virtue of which the government of the
West Indies was vested in his family for all time,
but it was all in vain. Ferdinand displayed the
same prejudice and injustice to the son that he
had to the father. All Diego&rsquo;s representations and
appeals for justice were disregarded. At last he ventured
to appeal from the King to the judge whose
duty it was to investigate and settle all questions
pertaining to America. To the everlasting glory of
this tribunal be it said that the judge had the courage
to decide against the King and in favor of the
heirs of Columbus, and to declare that Diego must
have the rights which were denied his father. Notwithstanding
this, in all likelihood the King would
have paid little attention to the decision had it not
been that Diego brought strong influence to bear
upon him. Elevated in rank by the decision of the
highest court in the Spanish kingdom, he asked for
the hand of the daughter of one of the most distinguished
men in the country, niece of a Duke of
Alva, and no objection was offered. This powerful
family urged the King so persistently and emphatically
to carry out his contract that he at last surrendered
and conceded Diego&rsquo;s claims. Ovando was
recalled and the Columbus family, victorious over
jealousy and injustice, embarked for Hispaniola.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<p>Accompanied by his brother, his uncle, and his
wife, Diego sailed for Hispaniola with almost kingly
pomp, and lived there in all the splendor which was
due to the great service his father had rendered
Spain. A great number of persons of rank followed
him there. In a short time the colony presented
an entirely different aspect and many of the most
flourishing and distinguished families in Spanish
America are descendants of those who accompanied
Diego.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">146</div>
<p>During Ovando&rsquo;s administration a certain Juan
Ponce<a class="fn" id="fr_20" href="#fn_20">[20]</a> sought permission to establish a colony upon
the island of Porto Rico, discovered by Columbus,
and his request was granted. He sailed thither,
accompanied by many adventurers, hoping to secure
great treasures, as the island was reported to be
rich in gold. The natives resembled those of Hispaniola
in their good nature and faithfulness. They
received the whites in the most cordial manner,
regarding them as celestial beings, and one of their
caciques, after the custom of the Indians, named
himself Juan Ponce Agueynaba, after the Spanish
leader, as a mark of eternal friendship. But these
greatly honored celestial friends soon threw off their
masks and showed themselves so cruel and inhuman
that the natives discovered they were only men.
To make sure that they were really mortal, the
leaders of these unfortunate people decided to make
the trial as thoroughly as possible with one individual.
With this purpose in view they waited an
opportunity and soon found one.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<p>A young Spaniard, wandering about the island
and feeling himself absolutely secure, came to the
cabin of one of the headmen among the natives to
spend the night with him. He was graciously received
and hospitably entertained. The next morning
his host assigned some Indians to accompany
him, partly to carry his bundles, and partly to act
as guides. They had been instructed in the meantime
what to do. Coming to a river, one of the
Indians offered to carry the Spaniard across and
took him upon his back. When they were in the
middle of the stream he intentionally fell, managing
to submerge the Spaniard. With the help of his
companions the Indian kept the victim under water
until he was drowned. Then they dragged his
body ashore. But their conviction of the immortality
of the Spaniards was so strong that they
were not even then certain the young Spaniard was
actually dead. Although the dead man gave no
sign of life they remained by him three days, unceasingly
praying for pardon, because they still
feared that he might come to life again. At last,
when convinced he was actually dead, they hastened
to bring the joyful news to the cacique that the
white men were mortal and could die. He did
not need to know more. He conveyed the news to
the other caciques and they at once courageously
determined to get rid of their tyrants by force.
But what could a naked, unwarlike people accomplish
against trained warriors armed with swords
and muskets and provided with horses and hounds?
They had a great advantage in point of numbers,
for over a hundred of them could surround and
murder one Spaniard, but they paid the penalty for
it with the loss of their freedom and happiness, for
when the Spaniards discovered their plan of killing
them individually, Ponce massed his warriors, who
were mostly veterans, hunted the Indians in their
hiding-places, slew them wherever he found them,
and made slaves of those who were not killed.
While engaged in this murderous business, reinforcements
came from Hispaniola which impressed the
superstitious islanders with the belief that the dead
Spaniards had come to life again and that it was
of no use longer to contend against those who could
not die. Victims of their own ignorance, they bowed
their necks under the hard yoke of slavery which
was now mercilessly put upon them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<p>In their accounts of the Porto Rico slaughtering
the historians of the time cannot sufficiently praise
the cunning and courage of a great hound, named
Bezerillo, and the astonishing deeds he performed.
He knew, they said, how to distinguish the Indian
friends and enemies of his masters. The Indians were
more afraid of ten Spaniards with this dog than of
a hundred without him. Before the outbreak they
used to give the Spaniards all the provisions, gold,
and even slaves they asked for to save themselves
from being harmed by the dog. The following story
of his cunning is also told: Some inhuman Spaniards
took delight in tormenting an old Indian
woman whom they disliked. Upon one occasion
they sent her off with a letter. She had hardly set
out before Bezerillo was let loose to run her down.
He fiercely pursued her but the woman threw herself
upon her knees, showed the dog the letter, and
said: &ldquo;O, gracious Sir Hound! I pray your grace,
spare me! I must deliver this letter to the Christians!&rdquo;
The dog, as if he clearly understood her,
wagged his tail and trotted back to his masters
without doing her any harm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<p>The happiness of these poor natives was gone
forever. The discoveries and conquests of the
Spaniards rapidly increased. The first step which
Diego took for the extension of his sway and the
increase of the royal possessions was the founding
of a colony on the island of Cubagua, discovered
by his father, to engage in pearl fisheries. These
pearls grow in certain mussels and oysters, not only
in the sea but also in rivers, and have to be taken
from the bottom. Some think that they come from
a disease of the shellfish, but this much is certain,
that the material of the pearls at first is a juice
which comes from the body of the fish and gradually
hardens. The pearl-fishers, who are mostly poor
men, dive into the water and bring them up. Diego
conceived that the work of these Indians, who were
used to swimming and diving, could be more profitably
employed in this manner than in mining. He
sent a number of them with the necessary European
overseers to Cubagua, where his father had found
that the waters abounded in pearls. The profits
of the fisheries both for the King and the governor
were exceedingly large, but the unfortunate natives
employed in the fishing found the work so unhealthy
and dangerous that most of them were lost. The
general barrenness of the island soon compelled the
colony to leave and settle in the adjacent island of
Margarita.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
<p>About this time Diego took possession of the
island of Jamaica. A colony was established and the
natives soon found themselves destined to the same
fate which had overtaken their brethren in Hispaniola
and Porto Rico. Next in order came Cuba.
Diego assigned its conquest to
Velasquez,<a class="fn" id="fr_21" href="#fn_21">[21]</a> a man
who had made himself famous on various occasions
during the lifetime of Columbus. A large number
of people who hoped to make their fortunes accompanied
him and a landing was made at the eastern
point of the island. This region at that time was
ruled by a cacique named Hatuey who had escaped
from slavery in Hispaniola and settled there. A
sworn enemy of the oppressors of his people, he had
long expected a visit from them and had arranged
with spies in Hispaniola to send him early news
of their movements. He now saw the dreaded
calamity at his doors. He summoned his followers,
announced the danger which threatened them, and
encouraged them to maintain their liberty to the
last drop of their blood. All courageously agreed
to follow him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is well,&rdquo; replied Hatuey, &ldquo;but one thing
more is necessary, my good people, if our efforts to
save ourselves from the tyrants are to be successful.
Do you know why they never come here to look
for their God among us? Do you know who their
God is? See him here! This is he!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<p>As he said this he showed them a basket of gold,
and assured them this worthless metal was their
God, for whom they were venturing everything and
seeking to hold possession of the island. &ldquo;Let us
hasten,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to celebrate this deity of the
Christians and secure His protection.&rdquo; Then in
the Indian fashion they began singing and dancing
around the basket. The festivity was kept up until
late into the night and did not cease until the entire
company had succumbed to weariness and exhaustion.
On the next day Hatuey summoned them
together again and told them that, notwithstanding
the honors they had paid to this deity, he was not
sure they would be safe so long as He remained on
the island. &ldquo;It is useless,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;to hide
Him. If you should swallow Him they would cut
you to pieces to find Him in your insides. So let
us throw Him into the sea so that He shall be no
longer upon our island.&rdquo; His advice was promptly
followed. They gathered all the gold they could
find and threw it into the ocean.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding this action the Spanish flags were
soon waving on their shores. Hatuey courageously
hastened to meet the foe. A battle ensued. The
natives were soon beaten and put to flight. Hatuey
himself was taken prisoner and, as a terrible example
to other caciques, was sentenced to be burned
alive. As he was standing at a pile of fagots, bound
to a stake, a Franciscan approached to describe
heaven to him, the place of the blessed after death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do the Spaniards also go to this blessed place?&rdquo;
inquired Hatuey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; replied the monk; &ldquo;but only the
good ones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is good for nothing,&rdquo; answered Hatuey, &ldquo;I
will go to no place where I shall be in danger of
meeting one of them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">152</div>
<p>This dreadful act of barbarity inspired the natives
all over Cuba with such fear that they no longer
thought of resistance but willingly subjected themselves
to the Spanish yoke. Thus in a few days the
Spaniards conquered one of the greatest and most
beautiful islands in the world without losing a man.
About this time various expeditions were sent out
to the mainland and preparations were made to
establish colonies and subject the natives.</p>
<p>Ponce, the conqueror of Porto Rico, heard from
several natives a story that was commonly believed
by those simple people. According to this story
there was an island toward the north and a wonderful
fountain upon it whose water had the remarkable
effect of making the person who drank it young and
strong again. Absurd as the story was, it so excited
the curiosity of the credulous Ponce that he determined
to search for the wonderful fountain.</p>
<p>With this purpose in view he set sail from Porto
Rico, directing his course northward toward the
Lucayan Islands. After reaching the twenty-sixth
degree of north latitude he changed his course to
the west and found to his great delight a large, beautiful
country, which we now know to have been a part
of North America, to which Ponce afterward gave
the name of Florida, either because it had such a
blooming appearance or because its discovery was
made at the season which is known as Easter day,
or, as it is called in Spanish, &ldquo;Pascua florida,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Flowery Easter.&rdquo; Thus a very silly story led to a
most important discovery.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<p>The attention of the Spaniards was shortly
directed to another part of the world, which had
hitherto been entirely unknown to them. They
conjectured the existence of a country in the same
latitude as that of the great rich Mexico, but no
one had yet tried to find it.</p>
<p>The famous man who opened up this country to
Europeans was Cortes.</p>

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</h2>

<p class="pgx">To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.</p>

<h3 class="pgx" title="Section 1. General Terms">Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p class="pgx">1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p class="pgx">1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p class="pgx">1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p class="pgx">1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p class="pgx">1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p class="pgx">1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p class="pgx">This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p class="pgx">1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p class="pgx">1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p class="pgx">1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p class="pgx">1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p class="pgx">1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p class="pgx">1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p class="pgx">1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p class="pgx">1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p class="pgx">1.F.</p>

<p class="pgx">1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p class="pgx">1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p class="pgx">1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p class="pgx">1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p class="pgx">1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p class="pgx">1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3 class="pgx" title="Section 2. The Mission of Project Gutenberg">Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p class="pgx">Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p class="pgx">Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3 class="pgx" title="Section 3. The Project Gutenberg Literary">Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p class="pgx">The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.</p>

<p class="pgx">The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

<h3 class="pgx" title="Section 4. Donations to PGLAF">Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p class="pgx">Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p class="pgx">The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p class="pgx">While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p class="pgx">International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p class="pgx">Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3 class="pgx" title="Section 5. Project Gutenberg Electronic Works">Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p class="pgx">Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p class="pgx">Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>
